# D11: Signal Variability Analysis

## Overview
Analyzes inter-run consistency and signal variability across repeated measurements.

## Key Findings
- Inter-run variability quantifies measurement consistency
- Coefficient of variation normalizes across signal strengths
- Both temporal and inter-run variability contribute to uncertainty

## Files
- `inter_run_variability.csv` - Between-run consistency
- `temporal_variability.csv` - Within-measurement variability
