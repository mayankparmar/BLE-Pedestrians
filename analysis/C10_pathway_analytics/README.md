# C10: Pathway Analytics

## Overview
Analyzes traffic flow and spatial usage patterns across pathway positions.

## Key Findings
- Balanced usage across all pathway positions
- Signal strength varies systematically along pathway
- Traffic flow intensity quantified (packets/second)
- Distance and position coverage analyzed

## Visualizations
- Position usage distribution
- Signal progression along pathway
- Traffic flow intensity by position
- RSSI heatmap (position × distance)

## Applications
- Traffic monitoring and flow analysis
- Spatial utilization mapping
- Position-specific threshold optimization

## Files
- `position_usage.csv` - Usage by position
- `signal_progression.csv` - Signal along pathway
- `traffic_flow.csv` - Flow intensity metrics
- `distance_distribution.csv` - Distance coverage
