   abstract = {Collecting pedestrian behaviour data is vital to understand pedestrian behaviour. This systematic review of 145 studies aims to determine the capability of contemporary data collection methods in collecting different pedestrian behavioural data, identify research gaps and discuss the possibilities of using new technologies to study pedestrian behaviour. The review finds that there is an imbalance in the number of studies that feature various aspects of pedestrian behaviour, most importantly (1) pedestrian behaviour in large complex scenarios, and (2) pedestrian behaviour during new types of high-risk situations. Additionally, three issues are identified regarding current pedestrian behaviour studies, namely (3) little comprehensive data sets featuring multi-dimensional behaviour data simultaneously, (4) generalizability of most collected data sets is limited, and (5) costs of pedestrian behaviour experiments are relatively high. A set of new technologies offers opportunities to overcome some of these limitations. This review identifies three types of technologies that can become a valuable addition to pedestrian behaviour research methods, namely (1) applying VR experiments to study pedestrian behaviour in the environments that are difficult or cannot be mimicked in real-life, repeat experiments to determine the impact of factors on pedestrian behaviour and collect more accurate behavioural data to understand the decision-making process of pedestrian behaviour deeply, (2) applying large-scale crowd monitoring to study pedestrian movements in large complex environments and incident situations, and (3) utilising the Internet of Things to track pedestrian movements at various locations that are difficult to investigate at the moment.},

@article{Moura2017,
   abstract = {Walkability has been defined as the extent to which the urban environment is pedestrian friendly. By measuring it, planning professionals may be able to address the quality of the pedestrian environment, supporting more objective, effective and comprehensive walking-related strategies and interventions. This work presents a participatory framework for the assessment of walkability based on local circumstances and expertise, replicable on distinct urban contexts. The framework takes into account distinct pedestrian groups (adults, children, seniors and impaired mobility pedestrians) and trip purposes (utilitarian, leisure), expressing walkability in terms of seven key dimensions (7C's layout). From this conceptual framework, a methodology to evaluate walkability through GIS-based and street auditing indicators is presented. It was applied to an area in central Lisbon, Portugal, in order to evaluate the ease or difficulty that different types of pedestrians can face in their walking activities and, potentially, providing an insight for intervention and improvements. The results show clear differences in walkability scores for different pedestrian groups, namely between adults and seniors or impaired pedestrians. Besides, a validation of the results is presented by comparing street performance, as measured by our process, with home-based surveys conducted within the study area. Validation results confirm that the evaluation framework proposed is reliable in the representation of the pedestrian environment qualities as perceived by the public.},

@article{Cavoukian2009,
   abstract = {Purpose: This document provides readers with additional information, clarification and guidance on applying the 7 Foundational Principles of Privacy by Design (PbD). This guidance is intended to serve as a reference framework and may be used for developing more detailed criteria for application and audit/verification purposes. Scope: These information management principles − and the philosophy and methodology they express − can apply to specific technologies, business operations, physical architectures and networked infrastructure, and even to entire information ecosystems and governance models. The universal principles of the Fair Information Practices (FIPs) are affirmed by those of Privacy by Design, but go beyond them to seek the highest global standard possible. Extending beyond FIPs, PbD represents a significant "raising" of the bar in the area of privacy protection. Context: With the shift from industrial manufacturing to knowledge creation and service delivery, the value of information and the need to manage it responsibly have grown dramatically. At the same time, rapid innovation, global competition and increasing system complexity present profound challenges for informational privacy. While we would like to enjoy the benefits of innovation − new conveniences and efficiencies − we must also preserve our freedom of choice and personal control over our data flows. Always a social norm, privacy has nonetheless evolved over the years, beyond being viewed solely as a legal compliance requirement, to also being recognized as a market imperative and critical enabler of trust and freedoms in our present-day information society. There is a growing understanding that innovation, creativity and competitiveness must be approached from a "design-thinking" perspective − namely, a way of viewing the world and overcoming constraints that is at once holistic, interdisciplinary, integrative, innovative, and inspiring. Privacy, too, must be approached from the same design-thinking perspective. Privacy must be incorporated into networked data systems and technologies, by default. Privacy must become integral to organizational priorities, project objectives, design processes, and planning operations. Privacy must be},
