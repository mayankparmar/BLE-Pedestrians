abstract = {Sustainable urban development requires providing a healthy and sustainable living environment with basic services for all. A healthy and multifunctional urban green structure is one of the basic services to provide. Urban and peri-urban forestry (UPF), focusing on the tree-dominated part of urban and peri-urban greenspace, is a strategic, integrative, interdisciplinary, and participatory approach. Its goal is to sustainably develop the multiple benefits of forests and trees in urban environments. Recently, UPF has found broad following across the world, but its potential for cities and towns in developing countries is unrealized. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has developed a mid-term strategy for promoting and developing UPF as a component of sustainable urban development, with emphasis on developing countries. This paper introduces this strategy, which aims at raising awareness, developing state of art, generating new technology and knowledge, strengthening institutions and policy, disseminating information and knowledge, and enhancing sustainable UPF. Examples of successful UPF programs from both the developing and developed world are presented. {\textcopyright} 2004 International Society of Arboriculture.},

abstract = {Walkability has been defined as the extent to which the urban environment is pedestrian friendly. By measuring it, planning professionals may be able to address the quality of the pedestrian environment, supporting more objective, effective and comprehensive walking-related strategies and interventions. This work presents a participatory framework for the assessment of walkability based on local circumstances and expertise, replicable on distinct urban contexts. The framework takes into account distinct pedestrian groups (adults, children, seniors and impaired mobility pedestrians) and trip purposes (utilitarian, leisure), expressing walkability in terms of seven key dimensions (7C's layout). From this conceptual framework, a methodology to evaluate walkability through GIS-based and street auditing indicators is presented. It was applied to an area in central Lisbon, Portugal, in order to evaluate the ease or difficulty that different types of pedestrians can face in their walking activities and, potentially, providing an insight for intervention and improvements. The results show clear differences in walkability scores for different pedestrian groups, namely between adults and seniors or impaired pedestrians. Besides, a validation of the results is presented by comparing street performance, as measured by our process, with home-based surveys conducted within the study area. Validation results confirm that the evaluation framework proposed is reliable in the representation of the pedestrian environment qualities as perceived by the public.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This document provides readers with additional information, clarification and guidance on applying the 7 Foundational Principles of Privacy by Design (PbD). This guidance is intended to serve as a reference framework and may be used for developing more detailed criteria for application and audit/verification purposes. Scope: These information management principles − and the philosophy and methodology they express − can apply to specific technologies, business operations, physical architectures and networked infrastructure, and even to entire information ecosystems and governance models. The universal principles of the Fair Information Practices (FIPs) are affirmed by those of Privacy by Design, but go beyond them to seek the highest global standard possible. Extending beyond FIPs, PbD represents a significant "raising" of the bar in the area of privacy protection. Context: With the shift from industrial manufacturing to knowledge creation and service delivery, the value of information and the need to manage it responsibly have grown dramatically. At the same time, rapid innovation, global competition and increasing system complexity present profound challenges for informational privacy. While we would like to enjoy the benefits of innovation − new conveniences and efficiencies − we must also preserve our freedom of choice and personal control over our data flows. Always a social norm, privacy has nonetheless evolved over the years, beyond being viewed solely as a legal compliance requirement, to also being recognized as a market imperative and critical enabler of trust and freedoms in our present-day information society. There is a growing understanding that innovation, creativity and competitiveness must be approached from a "design-thinking" perspective − namely, a way of viewing the world and overcoming constraints that is at once holistic, interdisciplinary, integrative, innovative, and inspiring. Privacy, too, must be approached from the same design-thinking perspective. Privacy must be incorporated into networked data systems and technologies, by default. Privacy must become integral to organizational priorities, project objectives, design processes, and planning operations. Privacy must be},

   abstract = {Collecting pedestrian behaviour data is vital to understand pedestrian behaviour. This systematic review of 145 studies aims to determine the capability of contemporary data collection methods in collecting different pedestrian behavioural data, identify research gaps and discuss the possibilities of using new technologies to study pedestrian behaviour. The review finds that there is an imbalance in the number of studies that feature various aspects of pedestrian behaviour, most importantly (1) pedestrian behaviour in large complex scenarios, and (2) pedestrian behaviour during new types of high-risk situations. Additionally, three issues are identified regarding current pedestrian behaviour studies, namely (3) little comprehensive data sets featuring multi-dimensional behaviour data simultaneously, (4) generalizability of most collected data sets is limited, and (5) costs of pedestrian behaviour experiments are relatively high. A set of new technologies offers opportunities to overcome some of these limitations. This review identifies three types of technologies that can become a valuable addition to pedestrian behaviour research methods, namely (1) applying VR experiments to study pedestrian behaviour in the environments that are difficult or cannot be mimicked in real-life, repeat experiments to determine the impact of factors on pedestrian behaviour and collect more accurate behavioural data to understand the decision-making process of pedestrian behaviour deeply, (2) applying large-scale crowd monitoring to study pedestrian movements in large complex environments and incident situations, and (3) utilising the Internet of Things to track pedestrian movements at various locations that are difficult to investigate at the moment.},

   abstract = {Our objective was to compare the effects on mental and physical wellbeing, health related quality of life and long-term adherence to physical activity, of participation in physical activity in natural environments compared with physical activity indoors. We conducted a systematic review using the following data sources: Medline, Embase, Psychinfo, GreenFILE, SportDISCUS, The Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index -Science and BIOSIS from inception to June 2010. Internet searches of relevant Web sites, hand searches of relevant journals, and the reference lists of included papers and other review papers identified in the search were also searched for relevant information. Controlled trials (randomized and nonrandomized) were included. To be eligible trials had to compare the effects of outdoor exercise initiatives with those conducted indoors and report on at least one physical or mental wellbeing outcome in adults or children. Screening of articles for inclusion, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third if necessary. Due to the heterogeneity of identified studies a narrative synthesis was performed. Eleven trials (833 adults) were included. Most participants (6 trials; 523 adults) were young students. Study entry criteria and methods were sparsely reported. All interventions consisted of a single episode of walking or running indoors with the same activity at a similar level conducted outdoors on a separate occasion. A total of 13 different outcome measures were used to evaluate the effects of exercise on mental wellbeing, and 4 outcome measures were used to assess attitude to exercise. Most trials (n = 9) showed some improvement in mental wellbeing on one or other of the outcome measures. Compared with exercising indoors, exercising in natural environments was associated with greater feelings of revitalization and positive engagement, decreases in tension, confusion, anger, and depression, and increased energy. However, the results suggested that feelings of calmness may be decreased following outdoor exercise. Participants reported greater enjoyment and satisfaction with outdoor activity and declared a greater intent to repeat the activity at a later date. None of the identified studies measured the effects of physical activity on physical wellbeing or the effect of natural environments on exercise adherence. The hypothesis that there are added beneficial effects to be gained from performing physical activity outdoors in natural environments is very appealing and has generated considerable interest. This review has shown some promising effects on self-reported mental wellbeing immediately following exercise in nature which are not seen following the same exercise indoors. However, the interpretation and extrapolation of these findings is hampered by the poor methodological quality of the available evidence and the heterogeneity of outcome measures employed. The review demonstrates the paucity of high quality evidence on which to base recommendations and reveals an undoubted need for further research in this area. Large, well designed, longer term trials in populations who might benefit most from the potential advantages of outdoor exercise are needed to fully elucidate the effects on mental and physical wellbeing. The influence of these effects on the sustainability of physical activity initiatives also awaits investigation. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Objective To assess the effects of interventions to promote walking in individuals and populations.

Design Systematic review.

Data sources Published and unpublished reports in any language identified by searching 25 electronic databases, by searching websites, reference lists, and existing systematic reviews, and by contacting experts.

Review methods Systematic search for and appraisal of controlled before and after studies of the effects of any type of intervention on how much people walk, the distribution of effects on walking between social groups, and any associated effects on overall physical activity, fitness, risk factors for disease, health, and wellbeing.

Results We included 19 randomised controlled trials and 29 non-randomised controlled studies. Interventions tailored to people's needs, targeted at the most sedentary or at those most motivated to change, and delivered either at the level of the individual (brief advice, supported use of pedometers, telecommunications) or household (individualised marketing) or through groups, can encourage people to walk more, although the sustainability, generalisability, and clinical benefits of many of these approaches are uncertain. Evidence for the effectiveness of interventions applied to workplaces, schools, communities, or areas typically depends on isolated studies or subgroup analysis.

Conclusions The most successful interventions could increase walking among targeted participants by up to 30-60 minutes a week on average, at least in the short term. From a perspective of improving population health, much of the research currently provides evidence of efficacy rather than effectiveness. Nevertheless, interventions to promote walking could contribute substantially towards increasing the activity levels of the most sedentary.},

Method: This study used data on 17,985 adult commuters in eighteen waves of the British Household Panel Survey (1991/2-2008/9). Fixed effects regression models were used to investigate how (i.) travel mode choice, (ii.) commuting time, and (iii.) switching to active travel impacted on overall psychological wellbeing and how (iv.) travel mode choice impacted on specific psychological symptoms included in the General Health Questionnaire. Results: After accounting for changes in individual-level socioeconomic characteristics and potential confounding variables relating to work, residence and health, significant associations were observed between overall psychological wellbeing (on a 36-point Likert scale) and (i.) active travel (0.185, 95% CI: 0.048 to 0.321) and public transport (0.195, 95% CI: 0.035 to 0.355) when compared to car travel, (ii.) time spent (per 10. minute change) walking (0.083, 95% CI: 0.003 to 0.163) and driving (- 0.033, 95% CI: - 0.064 to - 0.001), and (iii.) switching from car travel to active travel (0.479, 95% CI: 0.199 to 0.758). Active travel was also associated with reductions in the odds of experiencing two specific psychological symptoms when compared to car travel.

@article{Mishra2012,
   abstract = {Background: People with cancer undergoing active treatment experience numerous disease- and treatment-related adverse outcomes and poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Exercise interventions are hypothesized to alleviate these adverse outcomes. HRQoL and its domains are important measures of cancer survivorship, both during and after the end of active treatment for cancer. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise on overall HRQoL outcomes and specific HRQoL domains among adults with cancer during active treatment. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDRO, LILACS, SIGLE, SportDiscus, OTSeeker, Sociological Abstracts from inception to November 2011 with no language or date restrictions. We also searched citations through Web of Science and Scopus, PubMed's related article feature, and several websites. We reviewed reference lists of included trials and other reviews in the field. Selection criteria: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing exercise interventions with usual care or other type of non-exercise comparison intervention to maintain or enhance, or both, overall HRQoL or at least one distinct domain of HRQoL. Included trials tested exercise interventions that were initiated when adults with cancer were undergoing active cancer treatment or were scheduled to initiate treatment. Data collection and analysis: Five paired review authors independently extracted information on characteristics of included trials, data on effects of the intervention, and assessed risk of bias based on predefined criteria. Where possible, we performed meta-analyses for HRQoL and HRQoL domains for the reported difference between baseline values and follow-up values using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and a random-effects model by length of follow-up. We also reported the SMD at follow-up between the exercise and control groups. Because investigators used many different HRQoL and HRQoL domain instruments and often more than one for the same domain, we selected the more commonly used instrument to include in the SMD meta-analyses. We also report the mean difference for each type of instrument separately. Main results: We included 56 trials with 4826 participants randomized to an exercise (n = 2286) or comparison (n = 1985) group. Cancer diagnoses in trial participants included breast, prostate, gynecologic, hematologic, and other. Thirty-six trials were conducted among participants who were currently undergoing active treatment for their cancer, 10 trials were conducted among participants both during and post active cancer treatment, and the remaining 10 trials were conducted among participants scheduled for active cancer treatment. Mode of exercise intervention differed across trials and included walking by itself or in combination with cycling, resistance training, or strength training; resistance training; strength training; cycling; yoga; or Qigong. HRQoL and its domains were assessed using a wide range of measures. The results suggest that exercise interventions compared with control interventions have a positive impact on overall HRQoL and certain HRQoL domains. Exercise interventions resulted in improvements in: HRQoL from baseline to 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.55) or when comparing difference in follow-up scores at 12 weeks (SMD 0.47; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.79); physical functioning from baseline to 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD 0.69; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.22) or 6 months (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.55); or when comparing differences in follow-up scores at 12 weeks (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.45) or 6 months (SMD 0.29; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.50); role function from baseline to 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD 0.48; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.90) or when comparing differences in follow-up scores at 12 weeks (SMD 0.17; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.34) or 6 months (SMD 0.32; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.61); and, in social functioning at 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD 0.54; 95% CI 0.03 to 1.05) or when comparing differences in follow-up scores at both 12 weeks (SMD 0.16; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.27) and 6 months (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.44). Further, exercise interventions resulted in a decrease in fatigue from baseline to 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD -0.38; 95% CI -0.57 to -0.18) or when comparing difference in follow-up scores at follow-up of 12 weeks (SMD -0.73; 95% CI -1.14 to -0.31). Since there is consistency of findings on both types of measures (change scores and difference in follow-up scores) there is greater confidence in the robustness of these findings. When examining exercise effects by subgroups, exercise interventions had significantly greater reduction in anxiety for survivors with breast cancer than those with other types of cancer. Further, there was greater reduction in depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, and improvement in HRQoL, emotional wellbeing (EWB), physical functioning, and role function for cancer survivors diagnosed with cancers other than breast cancer but not for breast cancer. There were also greater improvements in HRQoL and physical functioning, and reduction in anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disturbances when prescribed a moderate or vigorous versus a mild exercise program. Results of the review need to be interpreted cautiously owing to the risk of bias. All the trials reviewed were at high risk for performance bias. In addition, the majority of trials were at high risk for detection, attrition, and selection bias. Authors' conclusions: This systematic review indicates that exercise may have beneficial effects at varying follow-up periods on HRQoL and certain HRQoL domains including physical functioning, role function, social functioning, and fatigue. Positive effects of exercise interventions are more pronounced with moderate- or vigorous-intensity versus mild-intensity exercise programs. The positive results must be interpreted cautiously because of the heterogeneity of exercise programs tested and measures used to assess HRQoL and HRQoL domains, and the risk of bias in many trials. Further research is required to investigate how to sustain positive effects of exercise over time and to determine essential attributes of exercise (mode, intensity, frequency, duration, timing) by cancer type and cancer treatment for optimal effects on HRQoL and its domains.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between physical activity and the risk of incident disability, including impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), in community-based older persons free of dementia. DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: Approximately 40 retirement communities across the Chicago metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: More than 1,000 older persons from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal clinical-pathological study of common chronic conditions of old age. MEASUREMENTS: All participants underwent detailed annual clinical evaluations that included assessments of physical activity, ADLs, IADLs, and gait performance. The associations between physical activity, mortality, and incident disability were examined using a series of Cox proportional hazards models controlled for age, sex, education, and baseline gait. RESULTS: At baseline, participants spent a mean±standard deviation of 3.0±3.5 hours per week engaging in physical activity (range 0-35). In a proportional hazards model, the risk of death decreased 11% (hazard ratio (HR)=0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.83-0.95) for each additional hour of physical activity per week. For those who were not disabled at baseline, the risk of developing disability in ADLs decreased 7% (HR=0.93, 95% CI=0.88-0.98) for each additional hour of physical activity per week. Similarly, the risk of disability in IADLs decreased 7% (HR=0.93, 95% CI=0.89-0.99) for each additional hour of physical activity. CONCLUSION: For community-based older persons without dementia, physical activity is associated with maintenance of functional status, including a reduced risk of developing impairment in ADLs and IADLs. © 2007, The American Geriatrics Society.},

Executive control processes and the prefrontal and frontal brain regions that support them show large and disproportionate changes with age. Studies of adult animals indicate that metabolic5 and neurochemical6 functions improve with aerobic fitness. We therefore investigated whether greater aerobic fitness in adults would result in selective improvements in executive control processes, such as planning, scheduling, inhibition and working memory. Over a period of six months, we studied 124 previously sedentary adults, 60 to 75 years old, who were randomly assigned to either aerobic (walking) or anaerobic (stretching and toning) exercise. We found that those who received aerobic training showed substantial improvements in performance on tasks requiring executive control compared with anaerobically trained subjects.},

This paper examines the proposition that more walkable neighbourhoods encourage local social interaction, a sense of community, informal social control and social cohesion; and that the relationship is explained by walking for transport or for recreation. Multilevel analyses of data from an Australian sample showed a modest association between the walkability of a neighbourhood and sense of community only. Walking for transport, but not recreation, mediated this relationship although the effect was small. These results support contentions that 'walkability' is more complex than usually defined and that factors influencing neighbourhood sociability extend beyond issues of urban form.},

Methods: A multi-level analysis of data from 4,317 older adults (mean age = 74.5; 73% black) from a geographically-defined urban community. Participants completed structured interviews including 14 questions on neighborhood conditions and self-reported walking. The neighborhood questions were summarized into individual-level measures of perceived neighborhood social cohesion and disorder. These measures were aggregated by neighborhood to construct neighborhood-level measures of social cohesion and disorder. Results: Neighborhood-level disorder, but not social cohesion, was significantly associated with walking, independent individual-level neighborhood perceptions and other correlates of walking. Further adjustment for race weakened this association to a marginally significant level. Discussion: Neighborhood conditions may shape walking behavior in older adults, especially conditions that reflect physical neglect or social threat. Promotion of walking behavior in older adults may require improvement of the safety and upkeep of the neighborhood environment. © 2009 Sage Publications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients are often advised to initiate a physical activity program by walking for transportation or leisure. This study explored whether neighborhood factors beyond the individual might affect compliance. OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations between total walking and neighborhood factors in a multi-ethnic population-based sample in California and the roles race/ethnicity plays in these associations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study PARTICIPANTS: Individual-level data were obtained from the 2003 California Health Interview Survey. Participants' census tracts were linked to Census 2000 data to capture neighborhood SES. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The dependent variable was self-reported walking at recommended levels. Neighborhood SES was measured by a scale of 4 Census-based variables (alpha=0.83). Social cohesion was measured by a scale tapping the extent of perceived social connectedness, trust, and solidarity among neighbors (alpha=0.70). Neighborhood access to a park, playground, or open space was measured by a single item. Safety was measured by a scale of three items (alpha=0.66). We performed a series of multiple logit models with robust variance estimates while taking complex survey design into account. Neighborhood social cohesion (odds ratio [OR]=1.09, 95% CI=1.04, 1.14) and access to a park, playground, or open space (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.16, 1.36) were significant environmental correlates of walking at recommended levels, independent of individual socio-demographics. Subgroup analysis showed that neighborhood effects were different by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood physical and social environmental factors are significantly associated with walking at recommended levels. Being aware of the ways that the environment could affect a patient's compliance with PA recommendations may help physicians tailor recommendations to circumstances. © 2007 Society of General Internal Medicine.},

@article{Mason2013,
   abstract = {Few studies have simultaneously examined the relationship of levels of recorded crime, perceptions of crime and disorder, and safety from crime with rates of physical activity. We developed a series of multilevel ordinal regression models to examine these aspects in relation to self-reported neighbourhood walking frequency in a cross-sectional sample of 3824 British adults from 29 deprived neighbourhoods in Glasgow, UK. Perceptions of several serious local antisocial behaviours (drunkenness and burglary) and feelings of personal safety (feeling safe in the home and if walking alone in the local area at night) were consistently associated, respectively, with less and more frequent walking. Conversely, perceiving drug dealing or drug use as a serious problem was associated with walking more frequently. There was a small but significant association between walking frequency in neighbourhoods with higher recorded person crime (but not property crime) rates when considered in conjunction with other aspects of disorder and crime safety, although not when additionally controlling for sociodemographic, neighbourhood and community aspects. The magnitude of these objective and perceived crime-related effects is modest and features of the psychosocial environment and social cohesion (having a sense of progress from living in the neighbourhood, group participation and positively rating social venues), as well as health and personal income deprivation, may more strongly determine levels of neighbourhood walking. Nevertheless, physical activity benefits may accrue at the population level through provision of environments that are safer from crime. Our study also shows the importance to local walking of neighbourhood management, which reduces problems of disorder, and of social regeneration, which helps strengthen sense of community. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This article reports a contextual analysis of social capital and individual self-rated health, with adjustment for individual household income, health behaviors, and other covariates. Methods. Self-rated health ('Is your overall health excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?') was assessed among 167259 individuals resing in 39 US states, sampled by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Social capital indicators, aggregated to the state level, were obtained from the General Social Surveys. Results. Individual-level factors (e.g., low income, low education, smoking) were strongly associated with self-rated poor health. However, even after adjustment for these proximal variables, a contextual effect of low social capital on risk of self-rated poor health was found. For example, the odds ratio for fair or poor health associated with living in areas with the lowest levels of social trust was 1.41 (95% confidence interval = 1.33, 1.50) compared with living in high-trust states. Conclusions. These results extend previous findings on the health advantages stemming from social capital.},

Mobile crowdsensing seems a promising solution for enabling the design/development and deployment of a wide range of advanced applications in various fields. In particular, public safety, transportation, and energy monitoring and management in urban environments can benefit from mobile crowdsensing in terms of advanced provisioned applications as well as savings of investments in the urban sensing infrastructure. However, enabling those advanced smart urban applications requires complex signal processing, machine learning, and resource management algorithms that are often beyond the skills of many mobile app developers. This paper describes the pivotal relevance of these facilities for mobile crowdsensing applications and presents our open-source solution, called Mobile Sensing Technology (MoST), for activity detection and geofencing, comparing it with the reference implementations provided by Google as part of the Google Play Services library. Experimental results within the testbed framework of a crowd-management application scenario validate MoST design guidelines and demonstrate the general-purpose, unintrusive, and power-efficient characteristics of MoST sensing capabilities.},

   abstract = {Participatory crowd monitoring estimates the size and dynamics of a crowd based on position data shared by people in the crowd. At large-scale events, these small but frequent uploads compete for bandwidth with the crowd's social networking activities causing transmission errors and long delays. Forwarding collected data within a peer-to-peer network allows for bundling that data and assigning the upload task to a few selected peers. On modern phones, however, peer discovery and networking is challenging due to tight restrictions of mobile operating systems. This paper shows how the announcement of internal state transitions via Bluetooth enables peers to align their operations and to accommodate for issues such as bandwidth restrictions, inexact timing, limited background activity, and idle times. Experiments on Android phones show that already for a small set of phones the proposed protocol works reliably and significantly reduces the use of the networking infrastructure. With the data delay and energy consumption in acceptable bounds, the protocol presents a viable solution for when network overload puts crowd monitoring data at risk of not being delivered in a timely manner.},

The MEPPP framework is applied to one case study, a participatory planning process in the Rwenzori region in Uganda. We suggest that this example can serve as a guideline for researchers and practitioners to set up the monitoring and evaluation of their participatory planning process of interest by following six main phases: (1) description of the case, (2) clarification of the M\&E viewpoint(s) and definition of the M\&E objective(s), (3) identification of the context, process and outputs/outcomes analytical variables, (4) development of the M\&E methods and data collection, (5) data analysis, and (6) sharing of the M\&E results. Results of the application of the MEPPP framework in Uganda demonstrate the ability of the framework to tackle the complexity of participatory planning processes.

abstract = {Participatory sensing has become an effective way of sensing urban dynamics due to the widespread availability of smartphones among citizens. Traditionally, separate urban sensing applications are designed to monitor different urban dynamics like environment, transportation, mobility, etc. However, combining these applications to aggregate information can lead to various new inferences. The main objective of this work is to improve urban sensing applications by overcoming their individual limitations. A unified framework called JUSense (Judicious Urban Sensing) is proposed that can derive benefits from these applications by combining their functionalities. JUSense provides the opportunity for applications to tackle the challenges associated with data collection, aggregation of data in cloud, calibration, data cleaning, and prediction. A multi-view fusion model is proposed for spatiotemporal urban air and noise pollution map generation. Further, a random forest classifier is built to classify the driving events. Here, large scale experiments are performed to evaluate the efficacy of JUSense on real-world dataset. Both the fusion model and the random forest classifier yield better accuracies compared to the baseline methods. Additionally, case studies are conducted to show the advantages that can arise out of the mutual interactions among the applications.},

abstract = {Participatory sensing is a powerful paradigm in which users participate in the sensing campaign by collecting and crowdsourcing fine-grained information and opinions about events of interest (such as weather or environment monitoring, traffic conditions or accidents, crime scenes, emergency response, healthcare and wellness management), thus leading to actionable inferences and decisions. Based on the nature of user involvement, participatory sensing applications can be of two types-automated and user manipulated. The first type of applications automatically collects data samples from smartphone sensors and sends them to the server. On the other hand, the second type of applications depends on the users to manually collect data samples and upload them at their convenience. Because of the high density of smartphone users in urban population and ease of participation, the automated participatory sensing paradigm can be effectively applied to continuous monitoring of various phenomena in urban scenarios (e.g., fine-grained temperature monitoring, noise or air pollution), leading to what is called participatory urban sensing. However, for creating a fine-grained and real-time map of the monitored area, the data samples need to be collected continuously (at a high frequency) which poses several research challenges. First, how to ensure coverage of the collected data that reflects how well the targeted area is monitored? Second, how to localize the smartphones since continuous usage of the location sensor (e.g., GPS) can drain the battery in few hours? Third, how to provide energy efficiency in the data collection process by collecting necessary data samples in each data collection round? In this article, we propose a novel framework called PLUS to address three major issues in real-time participatory urban monitoring applications, namely, ensuring coverage of the collected data, localization of the participating smartphones, and overall energy efficiency of the data collection process. Specifically the PLUS framework can guarantee a specified requirement of partial data coverage of the monitored area in an energy efficient manner. Additionally we devised a Markov-Predictor based energy efficient outdoor localization scheme for the mobile devices to participate in the data collection process. Simulation studies and real life experiments exhibit that PLUS can significantly reduce energy consumption of the mobile devices for urban monitoring applications as compared to traditional approaches.},

@article{Hassenforder2015,
abstract = {Many scholars point out that in complex and contested decision-making and planning situations, participatory processes have clear advantages over "traditional" or non-participatory processes. Improving our understanding of which participatory process elements or combination of elements contribute to specific outcomes demands a comparative diagnosis of multiple case studies based on a systematic framework. This paper describes the theoretical foundation and application of a diagnostic framework developed for the description and comparative analysis of participatory processes. The framework for the Comparison of Participatory Processes (COPP) is composed of three dimensions: context, process, and outputs outcomes and impacts. For each dimension, a list of variables is provided, with associated selectable options. The framework also requires clarification of three monitoring and evaluation elements. The COPP framework is then applied to five participatory processes across five different contexts: three located in the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and two in eastern Africa. The goal is to test first if the framework facilitates the development of a comprehensive and clear description of participatory processes, and second, if a diagnostic step can be facilitated by applying the descriptions in a cross-comparative analysis. The paper concludes that despite a few challenges, the COPP framework is sufficiently generic to derive clear and consistent descriptions. A sample of only five case studies restricts the derivation of robust insights. Nevertheless, three testable hypothesis were derived, which would need to be tested with a much larger sample of case studies in order to substantiate the efficacy of process characteristics and attributes. Ultimately, such hypotheses and subsequent analytical efforts would contribute to the advancement of this increasingly prominent research domain.},

   abstract = {Developing countries have a high frequency of traffic incidents involving pedestrians. Given the vulnerability of pedestrians, many of these incidents result in serious or fatal injuries. The present study aimed to validate a pedestrian behavior questionnaire in Iran to investigate Persian pedestrian behaviors and to understand the relationship of these behaviors with demographic and mobility variables. A total of 520 participants (292 males and 228 females) completed a survey containing behavioral items and demographic questions. A principal component analysis showed that the data best fit in four factors of transgressions (including violations and errors), lapses, aggressive behaviors, and positive behaviors. In this study, the association of behavioral dimensions with crash history as a driver, crash history as a pedestrian, the severity of an experienced pedestrian-related crash, and the participant's relative's crash history as a pedestrian were also investigated. The present study confirms that PBQ is a useful tool with adequate reliability for investigating Persian pedestrians' safety-related behaviors. These findings revealed the need for intervention programs and improving infrastructures through the evaluation of pedestrian behaviors, which may lead to decreasing pedestrian-related crash frequency.},

Therefore, this research estimates on one hand, through an observational study, four models to establish the significant variables in the pedestrians' obedience of traffic signals in a signalized intersection. On the other hand, it was proven through surveys, the level of road safety knowledge and how the socioeconomic factors influence the probability that pedestrians obey traffic signals and do not engage in risky behaviors. For the observational study, the variables analyzed are the pedestrian characteristics, obedience to signs, vehicle interaction, the time of day, and the infrastructure. The existence of vehicular flow, that the pedestrian crossing is obstructed and that the pedestrian waits in a group, are the variables with the greatest influence on the probability that the pedestrian does not assume risky behaviors when crossing. The factors that influence the probability of obeying the pedestrian traffic light are the existence of vehicular flow, the user running, and the time of the day; factors for the compliance of the pedestrian crossing are that the crossing is obstructed, the number of lanes, and the presence of vehicular flow; while for the probability of running, factors for compliance are obedience to the traffic light, that the user crosses in the group, and the location of the pedestrian crossing. This study is a first approach to estimate the variables that influence the observance of traffic signals and risk behaviors.},

As nonintrusive autonomous sensing and context recognition are desirable characteristics of a personal sensing system; efforts have been made to develop opportunistic sensing techniques on mobile phones. The resulting combination of these approaches has ushered in a new realm of applications, namely opportunistic user context recognition with mobile phones. This article surveys the existing research and approaches towards realization of such systems. In doing so, the typical architecture of a mobile-centric user context recognition system as a sequential process of sensing, preprocessing, and context recognition phases is introduced. The main techniques used for the realization of the respective processes during these phases are described, and their strengths and limitations are highlighted. In addition, lessons learned from previous approaches are presented as motivation for future research. Finally, several open challenges are discussed as possible ways to extend the capabilities of current systems and improve their real-world experience. © 2013 ACM.},

The challenge raised by the diversity is not how to select between the different views but how to combine and co-ordinate them. The purpose of this paper is to undertake an initial critical analysis of different approaches to urban morphology in an effort to meet that challenge. The first aim is to identify the range of different phenomena taken as the object of urban morphological enquiry. The second is to identify an aspect that is common to all the approaches and that can be used as a reference key to co-ordinate different views in a rigorous way.

   abstract = {Introduction: Half the world population lives in cities and this is likely to increase to 70\% over the next 20 years. Suboptimal urban and transport planning has led to e.g. high levels of air pollution and noise, heat island effects and lack of green space and physical activity and thereby an increase in morbidity and premature mortality. How can better urban and transport planning improve public health? Methods: A narrative meta-review around a number of cutting edge and visionary studies and practices on how to improve public health through better urban and transport planning reported in the literature and from meetings over the past few years. Results: We describe the latest quantitative evidence of how cities can become healthier through better urban and transport planning. It focuses and provides evidence for important interventions, policies and actions that can improve public health, including the need for land use changes, reduce car dependency and move towards public and active transportation, greening of cities, visioning, citizen involvement, collaboration, leadership and investment and systemic approaches. Health impact assessment studies have recently provided new powerful quantitative evidence on how to make cities healthier and will be used as examples. At the same time these measures make also our cities more sustainable (i.e. carbon neutral) and liveable creating multiple benefits. Conclusion: Better urban and transport planning can lead to carbon neutral, more liveable and healthier cities, particularly through land use changes, a move from private motorised transportation to public and active transportation and greening of cities.},

Although there is considerable evidence that urban sprawl has adverse affects on public health and the environment, policy frameworks designed to combat sprawl-such as smart growthhave proven to be controversial, making implementation difficult. Smart growth has generated considerable controversy because stakeholders affected by urban planning policies have conflicting interests and divergent moral and political viewpoints. In some of these situations, deliberative democracy -an approach to resolving controversial public-policy questions that emphasizes open, deliberative debate among the affected parties as an alternative to voting - would be a fair and effective way to resolve urbanplanning issues.},

The potential for altering air pollution through changing urban characteristics, however, is less certain, especially for expanding cities within the developing world. We examined changes in urban characteristics from 2000 to 2010 for 830 cities in East Asia to evaluate associations with changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. Urban areas were stratified by population size into small (100 000-250 000), medium, (250 000-1 000 000), and large (>1 000 000). Multivariate regression models including urban baseline characteristics, meteorological variables, and change in urban characteristics explained 37\%, 49\%, and 54\% of the change in NO2 and 29\%, 34\%, and 37\% of the change in PM2.5 for small, medium and large cities, respectively. Change in lights at night strongly predicted change in NO2 and PM2.5, while urban area expansion was strongly associated with NO2 but not PM2.5. Important differences between changes in urban characteristics and pollutant levels were observed by city size, especially NO2. Overall, changes in urban characteristics had a greater impact on NO2 and PM2.5 change than baseline characteristics, suggesting urban design and land use policies can have substantial impacts on local air pollution levels.},

The model AERMOD was used to simulate the dispersion of PM produced by heavy-duty vehicles fuel combustion and the methodology suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used to analyze the number of deaths attributed to the PM emitted. Results showed some municipalities with high PM concentrations, which exceeded the limits suggested by WHO. In terms of health issues, cardiovascular diseases in a population older than 30 years were the main cause of death from PM emissions. When it comes to fuel replacement, LNG helps to reduce PM emissions, but considering this reduction alone is not sufficient to avoid attributable deaths.},

Air pollution is responsible for millions of deaths and chronic and acute health problems every year, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The fossil‐fuel‐based transportation system releases tons of toxic gases into the atmosphere putting human health at risk, especially in urban areas. This analysis aims to determine the economic burden of environmental and health impacts caused by Highway 401 traffic. Due to the high volume of vehicles driving on the Toronto Highway 401 corridor, there is an annual release of 3771 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). These emissions are mainly emitted onsite through the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuel. The integration of electric and hydrogen vehicles shows maximum reductions of 405–476 g CO2e per vehicle‐kilometer. Besides these carbon dioxide emissions, there is also a large amount of hazardous air pollutants. To examine the impact of air pollution on human health, the mass and concentrations of criteria pollutants of PM2.5 and NOx emitted by passenger vehicles and commercial trucks on Highway 401 were determined using the MOVES2014b software. Then, an air dispersion model (AERMOD) was used to find the concentration of different pollutants at the receptor’s location. The increased risk of health issues was calculated using hazard ratios from literature. Finally, the health cost of air pollution from Highway 401 traffic was estimated to be CAD 416 million per year using the value of statistical life, which is significantly higher than the climate change costs of CAD 55 million per year due to air pollution.},

In practice, one of the most common and widely used regulations is the motor vehicle restriction policy (MVR policy). But it is unknown whether a motor vehicle restriction policy can effectively alleviate traffic pollution. Moreover, few studies considered the duration of the policy and distinct the effects of different types of MVR policies. In this paper, we first classify the MVR policies into consecutive and intermittent restrictions policies and analyze their different effects on air pollution based on the difference-in-differences method. Further, we take the Mediation Effect Model to verify the conduction mechanism of the impact. The result shows that both consecutive and intermittent policies can improve air quality, while the latter's effect is more significant. Moreover, as for the impact's conduction mechanism, we find that consecutive policies alleviate pollution by changing driving preference and vehicle purchase. Still, the intermittent policies alleviate pollution by promptly easing traffic jams and avoiding unnecessary vehicle emissions of the idling engine. This founding provides a decision-making basis to the government for more efficient and reasonable regulation policies.},

The functions that walking and walkable area can be support includes community involvement, health, meeting and gathering and recreation which has positive effects on sustainability and vice versa. Walkability is the basis of sustainable city. The same as bicycling, walking can be known as ‘green’ type of transportation which except crowding reduction and also has low level of environmental influence, energy conserving without any air and noise pollution. It can be more than a purely useful type of travel to shopping, school and work. Also have both social and recreational importance. This research aims at supporting urban design knowledge and practice and contributing to the broader field of “walkability” by refining the methods and measures used to analyse the relationship between walking behaviour and physical environment and its impacts on city sustainability. In order to integrate knowledge from theories and research on walkability from different fields and of different perspectives, it is crucial to first build a broader view and a more comprehensive understanding of how the built environment influences walking. What has been done during the earlier part of this project, and will be shown in this research, is to provide a better understanding of the complexity of the relationship between the built environment and walking and also the complexity that lies in both of these entities, the urban form and walking activity.},

   abstract = {A projected 60\% of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2030. Urbanization has major impacts on ecosystem services, and therefore human well-being, but not all groups within a community experience the impacts of urbanization on ecosystem services the same. It is important for decision-makers to understand the trade-offs that occur with urbanization, as it relates to ecosystem services provision, as well as the perceptions of importance of ecosystem services among a population. In this paper, we measured a)areas at environmental risk due to urban growth, b)differences in societal demand for ecosystem services between socio-demographic groups, c)perceptions of urban and agricultural impacts to ecosystem services, and d)public awareness of current ecosystem services trends, in the Boise, Idaho, metropolitan area, one of the fastest-growing areas in the United States. We applied urban growth projections to current land use-land cover, and found that agriculture is at highest risk of conversion. We then conducted over 400 face-to-face survey, measuring whether perceptions regarding ecosystem services from urban and agricultural land differ between socio-demographic groups. We found significant differences regarding perceived importance of ecosystem services. The general public placed higher importance on food production and alternative energy while experts placed higher importance on water quality and recreation. Overall, respondents perceived that urban land use negatively impacts more ecosystem services than agriculture land use. Urban areas were associated with positive impacts to local identity and recreation, while agriculture was positively associated with cultural heritage and food production. Both urban and agriculture land uses were negatively associated with water quality, air quality, and habitat for species with urban land having greater, negative impacts. Our results indicate a need to incorporate social demand for ecosystem services in urban planning, to ensure policy resilience and to appropriately address diverse perspectives.},

   abstract = {Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behaviour consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to 70\% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends, couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because of its “non-aerodynamic” shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among individuals.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols are associated with climate change and human health risks. We used a global model to estimate the climate and public health outcomes attributable to fossil fuel use, indicating the potential benefits of a phaseout. We show that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 (2.96–4.21) million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 (4.52–6.52) million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65\% of the excess mortality, and 70\% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Because aerosols affect the hydrologic cycle, removing the anthropogenic emissions in the model increases rainfall by 10–70\% over densely populated regions in India and 10–30\% over northern China, and by 10–40\% over Central America, West Africa, and the drought-prone Sahel, thus contributing to water and food security. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36(±0.06) °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C.},

   abstract = {Assessment of the global burden of disease is based on epidemiological cohort studies that connect premature mortality to a wide range of causes, including the long-term health impacts of ozone and fine particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5). It has proved difficult to quantify premature mortality related to air pollution, notably in regions where air quality is not monitored, and also because the toxicity of particles from various sources may vary. Here we use a global atmospheric chemistry model to investigate the link between premature mortality and seven emission source categories in urban and rural environments. In accord with the global burden of disease for 2010 (ref. 5), we calculate that outdoor air pollution, mostly by PM2.5, leads to 3.3 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.61-4.81) million premature deaths per year worldwide, predominantly in Asia. We primarily assume that all particles are equally toxic, but also include a sensitivity study that accounts for differential toxicity. We find that emissions from residential energy use such as heating and cooking, prevalent in India and China, have the largest impact on premature mortality globally, being even more dominant if carbonaceous particles are assumed to be most toxic. Whereas in much of the USA and in a few other countries emissions from traffic and power generation are important, in eastern USA, Europe, Russia and East Asia agricultural emissions make the largest relative contribution to PM2.5, with the estimate of overall health impact depending on assumptions regarding particle toxicity. Model projections based on a business-as-usual emission scenario indicate that the contribution of outdoor air pollution to premature mortality could double by 2050.},

   abstract = {The burning of fossil fuels – especially coal, petrol, and diesel – is a major source of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and a key contributor to the global burden of mortality and disease. Previous risk assessments have examined the health response to total PM2.5, not just PM2.5 from fossil fuel combustion, and have used a concentration-response function with limited support from the literature and data at both high and low concentrations. This assessment examines mortality associated with PM2.5 from only fossil fuel combustion, making use of a recent meta-analysis of newer studies with a wider range of exposure. We also estimated mortality due to lower respiratory infections (LRI) among children under the age of five in the Americas and Europe, regions for which we have reliable data on the relative risk of this health outcome from PM2.5 exposure. We used the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem to estimate global exposure levels to fossil-fuel related PM2.5 in 2012. Relative risks of mortality were modeled using functions that link long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality, incorporating nonlinearity in the concentration response. We estimate a global total of 10.2 (95\% CI: −47.1 to 17.0) million premature deaths annually attributable to the fossil-fuel component of PM2.5. The greatest mortality impact is estimated over regions with substantial fossil fuel related PM2.5, notably China (3.9 million), India (2.5 million) and parts of eastern US, Europe and Southeast Asia. The estimate for China predates substantial decline in fossil fuel emissions and decreases to 2.4 million premature deaths due to 43.7\% reduction in fossil fuel PM2.5 from 2012 to 2018 bringing the global total to 8.7 (95\% CI: −1.8 to 14.0) million premature deaths. We also estimated excess annual deaths due to LRI in children (0–4 years old) of 876 in North America, 747 in South America, and 605 in Europe. This study demonstrates that the fossil fuel component of PM2.5 contributes a large mortality burden. The steeper concentration-response function slope at lower concentrations leads to larger estimates than previously found in Europe and North America, and the slower drop-off in slope at higher concentrations results in larger estimates in Asia. Fossil fuel combustion can be more readily controlled than other sources and precursors of PM2.5 such as dust or wildfire smoke, so this is a clear message to policymakers and stakeholders to further incentivize a shift to clean sources of energy.},

   abstract = {Among the most interesting and challenging theoretical and practical problems in describing pedestrians behavior are route choice and activity scheduling. Compared to other modes of transport, a characteristic feature of pedestrian route choice is that routes are continuous trajectories in time and space: since a pedestrian chooses a route from an infinite set of alternatives, dedicated theories and models describing pedestrian route choice are required.This article puts forward a new theory of pedestrian behavior under uncertainty based on the concept of utility maximization. The main behavioral assumption is that pedestrians optimize some predicted pedestrian-specific utility function, representing a trade-off between the utility gained from performing activities at a specific location, and the predicted cost of walking subject to the physical limitations of the pedestrians and the kinematics of the pedestrian. The uncertainty reflects the randomness of the experienced traffic conditions.Based on this normative theory, route choice, activity area choice, and activity scheduling are simultaneously optimized using dynamic programming for different traffic conditions and uncertainty levels.

Yet, data publishing and mining do not come without dangers, namely privacy invasion and also potential discrimination of the individuals whose data are published. Discrimination may ensue from training data mining models (e.g. classifiers) on data which are biased against certain protected groups (ethnicity, gender, political preferences, etc.). The objective of this paper is to describe how to obtain data sets for publication that are: (i) privacy-preserving; (ii) unbiased regarding discrimination; and (iii) as useful as possible for learning models and finding patterns. We present the first generalization-based approach to simultaneously offer privacy preservation and discrimination prevention. We formally define the problem, give an optimal algorithm to tackle it and evaluate the algorithm in terms of both general and specific data analysis metrics (i.e. various types of classifiers and rule induction algorithms). It turns out that the impact of our transformation on the quality of data is the same or only slightly higher than the impact of achieving just privacy preservation. In addition, we show how to extend our approach to different privacy models and anti-discrimination legal concepts. © 2014 The Author(s).},

IoT devices are subject to threats from hackers and malware due to the explosive expansion of IoT and its use in commerce and critical infrastructures. Malware poses a severe danger to the availability and reliability of IoT devices. If left uncontrolled, it can have profound implications, as IoT devices and smart services can collect personally identifiable information (PII) without the user’s knowledge or consent. These devices often transfer their data into the cloud, where they are stored and processed to provide the end users with specific services. However, many IoT devices do not meet the same security criteria as non-IoT devices; most used schemes do not provide privacy and anonymity to legitimate users. Because there are so many IoT devices, so much malware is produced every day, and IoT nodes have so little CPU power, so antivirus cannot shield these networks from infection. Because of this, establishing a secure and private environment can greatly benefit from having a system for detecting malware in IoT devices. In this paper, we will analyze studies that have used ML as an approach to solve IoT privacy challenges, and also investigate the advantages and drawbacks of leveraging data in ML-based IoT privacy approaches. Our focus is on using ML models for detecting malware in IoT devices, specifically spyware, ransomware, and Trojan horse malware. We propose using ML techniques as a solution for privacy attack detection and test pattern generation in the IoT. The ML model can be trained to predict behavioral architecture. We discuss our experiments and evaluation using the “MalMemAnalysis” datasets, which focus on simulating real-world privacy-related obfuscated malware. We simulate several ML algorithms to prove their capabilities in detecting malicious attacks against privacy. The experimental analysis showcases the high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting obfuscated and concealed malware, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 99.50%, and would be helpful in safeguarding an IoT network from malware. Experimental analysis and results are provided in detail.},

These strategies help IT architects to support privacy by design early in the software development life cycle, during concept development and analysis. Using current data protection legislation as point of departure we derive the following eight privacy design strategies: MINIMISE, HIDE, SEPARATE, AGGREGATE, INFORM, CONTROL, ENFORCE, and DEMONSTRATE. The strategies also provide a useful classification of privacy design patterns and the underlying privacy enhancing technologies. We therefore believe that these privacy design strategies are not only useful when designing privacy friendly systems, but also helpful when evaluating the privacy impact of existing IT systems.},

This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

   abstract = {In today’s hyperconnected world, the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing complement each other in several areas. Cloud Computing provides IoT systems with an efficient and flexible environment that supports application requirements such as real-time control/monitoring, scalability, fault tolerance, and numerous security services. Hardware and software limitations of IoT devices can be mitigated using the massive on-demand cloud resources. However, IoT cloud-based solutions pose some security and privacy concerns, specifically when an untrusted cloud is used. This calls for strong encryption schemes that allow operations on data in an encrypted format without compromising the encryption. This paper presents an asymmetric multi-key and partially homomorphic encryption scheme. The scheme provides the addition operation by encrypting each decimal digit of the given integer number separately using a special key. In addition, data integrity processes are performed when an untrusted third party performs homomorphic operations on encrypted data. The proposed work considers the most widely known issues like the encrypted data size, slow operations at the hardware level, and high computing costs at the provider level. The size of generated ciphertext is almost equal to the size of the plaintext, and order-preserving is ensured using an asymmetrical encryption version.},

However, a barrier to the use of synthetic data is the uncertainty about the reliability and validity of the results that are derived from these data. Surprisingly, there has been a relative dearth of research on how to measure the utility of synthetic data. Utility measures developed to date have been either information theoretic abstractions or somewhat arbitrary collations of statistics, and replication of previously published results has been rare. In this paper, we adopt a methodology previously used by Purdam and El-liot (2007), in which they replicated published analyses using disclosure-controlled versions of the same microdata used in said analyses and then evaluated the impact of disclosure control on the analytic outcomes. We utilise the same studies as Purdam and Elliot, based on the 1991 UK Samples of Anonymised Records, to facilitate comparisons of synthetic data utility between different utility metrics.},

   abstract = {The k-anonymity privacy requirement for publishing microdata requires that each equivalence class (i.e., a set of records that are indistinguishable from each other with respect to certain "identifying" attributes) contains at least k records. Recently, several authors have recognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of ℓ-diversity has been proposed to address this; ℓ-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least ℓ well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper we show that ℓ-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the Earth Mover Distance measure for our t-closeness requirement. We discuss the rationale for t-closeness and illustrate its advantages through examples and experiments. © 2007 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Currently, a significant focus has been established on the privacy protection of multi-dimensional data publishing in various application scenarios, such as scientific research and policy-making. The K-anonymity mechanism based on clustering is the main method of shared-data desensitization, but it will cause problems of inconsistent clustering results and low clustering accuracy. It also cannot defend against several common attacks, such as skewness and similarity attacks at the same time. To defend against these attacks, we propose a K-anonymity privacy protection algorithm for multi-dimensional data against skewness and similarity attacks (KAPP) combined with t-closeness. Firstly, we propose a multi-dimensional sensitive data clustering algorithm based on improved African vultures optimization. More specifically, we improve the initialization, fitness calculation, and solution update strategy of the clustering center. The improved African vultures optimization can provide the optimal solution with various dimensions and achieve highly accurate clustering of the multi-dimensional dataset based on multiple sensitive attributes. It ensures that multi-dimensional data of different clusters are different in sensitive data. After the dataset anonymization, similar sensitive data of the same equivalence class will become less, and it eventually does not satisfy the premise of being theft by skewness and similarity attacks. We also propose an equivalence class partition method based on the sensitive data distribution difference value measurement and t-closeness. Namely, we calculate the sensitive data distribution’s difference value of each equivalence class and then combine the equivalence classes with larger difference values. Each equivalence class satisfies t-closeness. This method can ensure that multi-dimensional data of the same equivalence class are different in multiple sensitive attributes, and thus can effectively defend against skewness and similarity attacks. Moreover, we generalize sensitive attributes with significant weight and all quasi-identifier attributes to achieve anonymous protection of the dataset. The experimental results show that KAPP improves clustering accuracy, diversity, and anonymity compared to other similar methods under skewness and similarity attacks.},

   abstract = {Differential privacy provides a way to get useful information about sensitive data without revealing much about any one individual. It enjoys many nice compositionality properties not shared by other approaches to privacy, including, in particular, robustness against side-knowledge.Designing differentially private mechanisms from scratch can be a challenging task. One way to make it easier to construct new differential private mechanisms is to design a system which allows more complex mechanisms (programs) to be built from differentially private building blocks in principled way, so that the resulting programs are guaranteed to be differentially private by construction.This paper is about a new accounting principle for building differentially private programs. It is based on a simple generalisation of classic differential privacy which we call Personalised Differential Privacy (PDP). In PDP each individual has its own personal privacy level. We describe ProPer, a interactive system for implementing PDP which maintains a privacy budget for each individual. When a primitive query is made on data derived from individuals, the provenance of the involved records determines how the privacy budget of an individual is affected: the number of records derived from Alice determines the multiplier for the privacy decrease in Alice's budget. This offers some advantages over previous systems, in particular its fine-grained character allows better utilisation of the privacy budget than mechanisms based purely on the concept of global sensitivity, and it applies naturally to the case of a live database where new individuals are added over time.We provide a formal model of the ProPer approach, prove that it provides personalised differential privacy, and describe a prototype implementation based on McSherry's PINQ system.},

   abstract = {There are currently two approaches to anonymization: "utility first" (use an anonymization method with suitable utility features, then empirically evaluate the disclosure risk and, if necessary, reduce the risk by possibly sacrificing some utility) or "privacy first" (enforce a target privacy level via a privacy model, e.g., k-anonymity or ε-differential privacy, without regard to utility). To get formal privacy guarantees, the second approach must be followed, but then data releases with no utility guarantees are obtained. Also, in general it is unclear how verifiable is anonymization by the data subject (how safely released is the record she has contributed?), what type of intruder is being considered (what does he know and want?) and how transparent is anonymization towards the data user (what is the user told about methods and parameters used?). We show that, using a generally applicable reverse mapping transformation, any anonymization for microdata can be viewed as a permutation plus (perhaps) a small amount of noise; permutation is thus shown to be the essential principle underlying any anonymization of microdata, which allows giving simple utility and privacy metrics. From this permutation paradigm, a new privacy model naturally follows, which we call (d, v, f)-permuted privacy. The privacy ensured by this method can be verified by each subject contributing an original record (subject-verifiability) and also at the data set level by the data protector. We then proceed to define a maximum-knowledge intruder model, which we argue should be the one considered in anonymization. Finally, we make the case for anonymization transparent to the data user, that is, compliant with Kerckhoff's assumption (only the randomness used, if any, must stay secret).},

   abstract = {In considering the human contribution to accidents, it seems necessary to make a distinction between errors and violations; two forms of aberration which may have different psychological origins and demand different modes of remediation. The present study investigated whether this distinction was justified for self-reported driver behaviour. Five hundred and twenty drivers completed a driver behaviour questionnaire (DBQ) which asked them to judge the frequency with which they committed various types of errors and violations when driving. Three fairly robust factors were identified: violations, dangerous errors, and relatively harmless lapses, respectively. Violations declined with age, errors did not. Men of all ages reported more violations than women. Women, however, were significantly more prone to harmless lapses (or more honest) than men. These findings were consistent with the view that errors and violations are indeed mediated by different psychological mechanisms. Violations require explanation in terms of social and motivational factors, whereas errors (slips, lapses, and mistakes) may be accounted for by reference to the information-processing characteristics of the individual. © 1990 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

A stratified sample of drivers (N = 881) was surveyed with a questionnaire constructed to measure attitudes toward behaviors, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intentions, the key constructs in TPB. Results showed that the addition of perceived behavioral control led to significant increments in the amount of explained variance in intentions, thereby supporting the theory. The relation between subjective norms and behavioral intentions was consistently stronger than that between attitudes toward behaviors and behavioral intentions. Analyses of variance differentiated demographic subgroups of drivers in terms of behavioral beliefs, outcome evaluations, normative beliefs, motivation to comply, and control beliefs.},

In recent 5 years, researchers have started to investigate pedestrian group movement. The aim of this work is to explore the local behavior of pedestrian groups by questionnaires and field observation. Survey study focused on pedestrians' psychology when walking in groups, which included five parts: group size, interpersonal distance, spatial relationship among group members, speed adjustment of group members, information transmission, and acid action among group members. Meantime a field observation was carried out to study group movement characteristics, which contained speed, step frequency, offset angle and interpersonal distance. The survey results show that group members have a closer interpersonal distance, faster information transmission and plenty of acid action. Conversely, group walking has a negative influence on pedestrian's speed, step frequency by comparing with the way isolated pedestrian walks. In addition, it is found that for a certain group, the group members are able to keep movement consistent. Also there exists obvious movement diversity among different group types (male dyads, female dyads, couple groups, and ordinary-friend groups) because of different gender and social relationship. Ultimately the results will be more promising for helping to model the movement of pedestrian groups.},

Factor 1, "transgres-sion", included items concerning offence of legal rules and errors. Factor 2 included "lapses" items. Factor 3 comprised "aggressive behavior" items and factor 4 included "positive behavior" items. A revised version of the PBS with 20 items was produced by selecting those items that loaded most strongly on the four factors. The 20-item version had good internal reliability. The effects of demographic and mobility variables on the PBS scores were investigated. This instrument will be useful in measuring the frequency of these different types of behaviors among the pedestrians who are most at risk, analyzing the psychological factors used to predict PBS scores and thus better adapt preventive actions to the different populations of vulnerable road users of all ages.},

An Adolescent Road user Behaviour Questionnaire (ARBQ) was developed, comprising 43 items requiring respondents to rate the frequency with which they engaged in specific examples of road-using behaviour. The questionnaire was completed by 2433 children aged 11-16. Factor analysis showed that responses to the 43 items were best fitted by a three-factor solution. Factor 1 comprised items relating to "unsafe road crossing behaviour", factor 2 comprised items related to "dangerous playing in the road", and factor 3 comprised items which as a group were termed "planned protective behaviour". A revised 21-item ARBQ was produced by selecting the items that loaded most strongly on the three factors. The 21-item instrument had good internal reliability. The effects of demographic variables on ARBQ scale scores were investigated. This study provided a tool that could be used in the future by researchers investigating adolescent road user safety. Possible avenues for future research include applying the ARBQ to the study of adolescents' road accident involvement, and the study of the psychological variables that predict the ARBQ scales. © 2004 TRL Ltd.

The evaluation of the planned behavior model using EQS showed a significant fit (v 2 ð11Þ ¼ 16:04 p ¼ 0:14; normal fit index ¼ 0:937). The reported violations, errors and lapses appears causally related to the intention to violate regulations , and this in turn with positive attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. Young people have a more positive attitude towards committing violations as pedestrians than adults and perceive the subjective norm to be less inhibitory, have less control over violations, have a more positive intention to commit violations, and report more violations, errors, and lapses than adults. Men report more frequent violations of the traffic rules than women do. The conclusion is drawn that pedestrians, and in particular young males, are at least in part responsible for the high accident rates and remedial actions are suggested.},

This paper aims to identify the walkability drivers in urban areas and investigate walkability behavior. The survey was carried out in southern Brazil, with a sample of 439 respondents. Data were subject to factorial analysis, regression analysis, and variance analysis. The analysis revealed four walkability drivers that explain pedestrian behavior: (i) infrastructure, (ii) traffic conditions and behavior, (iii) built and natural environments, and (iv) social relations. The results show that built and natural environments and social relations were the most significant aspects in explaining walkability’s overall perception. Concerning socio-demographic aspects, the study points out that (i) men feel safer than women when walking in the neighborhood; (ii) the presence of trees and attractive places along the street increases the walking behavior of non-sedentary people; and (iii) the perception of the neighborhood’s beauty increases with age. The research provides contributions regarding understanding the interrelated aspects of walkability behavior. Finally, the study offers relevant evidence for social researchers and urban planners by identifying walkability drivers and supporting political and academic debate elements.},

   abstract = {This study analyzes pedestrian receptivity toward fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs) by developing and validating a pedestrian receptivity questionnaire for FAVs (PRQF). The questionnaire included sixteen survey items based on attitude, social norms, trust, compatibility, and system effectiveness. 482 Participants from the United States (273 males and 209 females, age range: 18–71 years) responded to an online survey. A principal component analysis determined three subscales describing pedestrians’ receptivity toward FAVs: safety, interaction, and compatibility. This factor structure was verified by a confirmatory factor analysis and reliability of each subscale was confirmed (0.7 < Cronbach's alpha < 0.9). Regression analyses investigated associations with scenario-based responses to the three PRQF subscale scores. Pedestrians’ intention to cross the road in front of FAVs was significantly predicted by both safety and interaction scores, but not by the compatibility score. Accepting FAVs in the existing traffic system was predicted by all three subscale scores. Demographic influence on the receptivity revealed that males and younger respondents were more receptive toward FAVs. Similarly, those from urban areas and people with higher personal innovativeness showed higher receptivity. Finally, a significant effect of pedestrian behavior (as measured by the pedestrian behavior questionnaire) on receptivity is explored. People who show positive behavior believed that the addition of FAVs will improve overall traffic safety. Those who show higher violation, lapse and aggression scores, were found to feel more confident about crossing the road in front of a FAV. This questionnaire can be a potential research tool for designing and improving FAVs for road-users outside the vehicles.},

We have come to a point that many of the models on pedestrian analytics introduced in the last decade, which have mostly not been validated, can now be tested using real-world data sets. In this survey we concentrate exclusively on automatically gathering such data sets, which we refer to as sensing the behavior of pedestrians. We roughly distinguish two approaches: one that requires users to explicitly use local applications and wearables, and one that scans the presence of handheld devices such as smartphones. We come to the conclusion that despite the numerous reports in popular media, relatively few groups have been looking into practical solutions for sensing pedestrian behavior. Moreover, we end that much work is still needed, in particular when it comes to combing privacy, transparency , scalability, and ease of deployment. We report on over 90 relevant articles and discuss and compare in detail 30 reports on sensing pedestrian behavior. ACM Reference format: Adriana Draghici and Maarten van Steen. 0.

   abstract = {Although cities occupy only 2 percent of the planet's surface, their inhabitants use 75 percent of its natural resources; by 2050, 70 percent of the global population will live in cities and towns. Sustainable urban development is crucial, therefore, for ensuring the quality of life of the world's people. Forests and trees in cities, if properly managed, can make important contributions to the planning, design and management of sustainable, resilient urban landscapes. They can help make cities more pleasant, attractive and healthy places in which to live, as well as safer, wealthier and more diverse. A few years ago, FAO initiated a collaborative process to develop voluntary guidelines aimed at optimizing the contributions of forests and trees to sustainable urban development. Scientists, practitioners and public administrators from cities worldwide were brought together to discuss the elements and key challenges of urban forestry, and a smaller team of experts was assembled to distil this vast knowledge. This document is the ultimate result of that process. Intended for a global audience comprising urban decision-makers, civil servants, policy advisors and other stakeholders, it will assist in the development of urban and peri-urban forests that help meet the present and future needs of cities for forest products and ecosystem services. These guidelines will also help increase community awareness of the contributions that forests and trees can make to improving quality of life, and of their essential role in global sustainability.},

Benefits include flexibility to react to environmental change and the promotion of opportunities for society to reconnect with nature. Criticisms include the lack of a clear conceptualization of rewilding, insufficient knowledge about possible outcomes, and the perception that rewilding excludes people from landscapes. Here, we present a framework for rewilding that addresses these concerns.We suggest that rewilding efforts should target trophic complexity, natural disturbances, and dispersal as interacting processes that can improve ecosystem resilience and maintain biodiversity.We propose a structured approach to rewilding projects that includes assessment of the contributions of nature to people and the social-ecological constraints on restoration.},

   abstract = {Trophic rewilding is an ecological restoration strategy that uses species introductions to restore top-down trophic interactions and associated trophic cascades to promote self-regulating biodiverse ecosystems. Given the importance of large animals in trophic cascades and their widespread losses and resulting trophic downgrading, it often focuses on restoring functional megafaunas. Trophic rewilding is increasingly being implemented for conservation, but remains controversial. Here, we provide a synthesis of its current scientific basis, highlighting trophic cascades as the key conceptual framework, discussing the main lessons learned from ongoing rewilding projects, systematically reviewing the current literature, and highlighting unintentional rewilding and spontaneous wildlife comebacks as underused sources of information. Together, these lines of evidence show that trophic cascades may be restored via species reintroductions and ecological replacements. It is clear, however, that megafauna effects may be affected by poorly understood trophic complexity effects and interactions with landscape settings, human activities, and other factors. Unfortunately, empirical research on trophic rewilding is still rare, fragmented, and geographically biased, with the literature dominated by essays and opinion pieces.Wehighlight the need for applied programs to include hypothesis testing and science-based monitoring, and outline priorities for future research, notably assessing the role of trophic complexity, interplay with landscape settings, land use, and climate change, as well as developing the global scope for rewilding and tools to optimize benefits and reduce human-wildlife conflicts. Finally, we recommend developing a decision framework for species selection, building on functional and phylogenetic information and with attention to the potential contribution from synthetic biology.},

   abstract = {Sustaining wildlife populations, which provide both ecosystem services and disservices, represents a worldwide conservation challenge. The ecosystem services and Ostrom's social–ecological systems frameworks have been adopted across natural and social sciences to characterize benefits from nature. Despite their generalizability, individually they do not include explicit tools for addressing the sustainable management of many wildlife populations. For instance, Ostrom's framework does not specifically address competing perspectives on wildlife, whereas the ecosystem services framework provides a limited representation of the social and governance context wherein such competing perspectives are embedded. We developed a unified social–ecological framework of ecosystem disservices and services (SEEDS) that advances both frameworks by explicitly acknowledging the importance of competing wildlife perspectives embedded in the social and governance contexts. The SEEDS framework emulates the hierarchical structure of Ostrom's social–ecological systems, but adds subsystems reflecting heterogeneous stakeholder views and experiences of wildlife-based services and disservices. To facilitate operationalizing SEEDS and further broader analyses across human–wildlife systems, we devised a list of variables to describe SEEDS subsystems, such as types and level of services and disservices, cost and benefit sharing, and social participation of stakeholders. Steps to implement SEEDS involve engaging local communities and stakeholders to define the subsystems, analyze interactions and outcomes, and identify leverage points and actions to remedy unwanted outcomes. These steps connect SEEDS with other existing approaches in social–ecological research and can guide analyses across systems or within individual systems to provide new insights and management options for sustainable human–wildlife coexistence.},

Research for over two decades has resulted in a large literature, yet there is little consensus on the applicability or even the existence of general principles or broad considerations that could guide landscape conservation. We assess six major themes in the ecology and conservation of landscapes. We identify 13 important issues that need to be considered in developing approaches to landscape conservation. They include recognizing the importance of landscape mosaics (including the integration of terrestrial and aquatic areas), recognizing interactions between vegetation cover and vegetation configuration, using an appropriate landscape conceptual model, maintaining the capacity to recover from disturbance and managing landscapes in an adaptive framework. These considerations are influenced by landscape context, species assemblages and management goals and do not translate directly into on-the-ground management guidelines but they should be recognized by researchers and resource managers when developing guidelines for specific cases. Two crucial overarching issues are: (i) a clearly articulated vision for landscape conservation and (ii) quantifiable objectives that offer unambiguous signposts for measuring progress. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Cities are dependent on the ecosystems beyond the city limits, but also benefit from internal urban ecosystems. The aim of this paper is to analyze the ecosystem services generated by ecosystems within the urban area. 'Ecosystem services' refers to the benefits human populations derive from ecosystems. Seven different urban ecosystems have been identified: street trees; lawns/parks; urban forests; cultivated land; wetlands; lakes/sea; and streams. These systems generate a range of ecosystem services. In this paper, six local and direct services relevant for Stockholm are addressed: air filtration, micro climate regulation, noise reduction, rainwater drainage, sewage treatment, and recreational and cultural values. It is concluded that the locally generated ecosystem services have a substantial impact on the quality-of-life in urban areas and should be addressed in land-use planning.},

The aim of the project was to: (i) understand the ecological characteristics of the biota of cities model, (ii) examine the effects of habitat fragment size and connectivity upon the ecological diversity and individual species distributions, (iii) predict biodiversity in cities, and (iv) analyse the extent to which the flora and fauna utilise the 'urban greenways' both as wildlife corridors and as habitats in their own right. The results suggest that cities provide habitats for rich and diverse range of plants and animals, which occur sometimes in unlikely recombinant communities. The studies on carabids and butterflies illustrated the relative importance of habitat quality on individual sites as opposed to site location within the conurbation. This suggests that dispersal for most of our urban species is not a limiting factor in population persistence, although elements of the woodland carabid fauna did appear to have some geographical structuring. Theoretical models suggested that dormice and water voles may depend on linear habitats for dispersal. The models also indicated that other groups, such as small and medium sized mammals, may use corridors, although field-based research did not provide any evidence to suggest that plants or invertebrates use urban greenways for dispersal. This finding indicates the importance of identifying a target species or group of species for urban greenways intended as dispersal routeways rather than as habitat in their own right.

Knowledge regarding how wildlife respond to anthropogenic change is vital for informing conservation efforts in such landscapes, including the design of nature reserves and wildlife corridors. To better understand how threatened species persist and behave within human-dominated landscapes, we examined the home range and space use of the nationally endangered southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus obesulus in peri-urban Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city. Specifically, we examined whether: (1) bandicoots were confined to linear strips of remnant vegetation or also made use of the broader highly modified landscape matrix; (2) the configuration of the linear vegetated strips affected home range shape; and (3) home range area differed between bandicoots living in linear strips and those in larger remnant habitat patches. We found that: (1) 71% of adult males and 33% of adult females used the matrix, but non-dispersing juveniles were entirely confined to the linear strips; males also travelled greater distances into the matrix (away from the vegetated strips) than females; (2) bandicoots had longer home ranges in narrower strips and males had longer home ranges than females; and (3) home range area for both sexes was smaller in linear strips than has been recorded in other studies in larger remnant habitats. Our study highlights the importance of retaining narrow, fragmented and modified vegetation to accommodate threatened biodiversity within human-dominated landscapes, but suggests the surrounding matrix may also offer important resources for adaptable species, such as bandicoots. Supporting off-reserve conservation of biodiversity in novel ecosystems is increasingly pertinent in our rapidly urbanizing world.},

Among intensive farmland in the Netherlands, landscape ecologists measure the length of hedgerows that connect small farm woods where bird populations have been censused. In the rangelands of Tanzania, wildlife managers document the pathways followed by herds of Wildebeest and Zebra during seasonal migratory movements. Across rural districts of southern Australia, community volunteers drive along country roads to assess and map the quality of remnant strips of roadside vegetation. What do these activities have in common? Is there a common thread among these diverse actions in different countries across several continents? The examples noted above each illustrate a way in which scientists, planners, local communities or concerned individuals are promoting measures to assist the movements of animals or to maintain the continuity of species populations and ecological processes in the face of habitat change.

   abstract = {Novel ecosystems are increasingly common worldwide, particularly in areas heavily impacted by humans such as urban and peri-urban landscapes. Consequently, interest in their potential contribution to biodiversity conservation is growing, including their ability to sustain populations of threatened species. However, few studies have explored whether novel habitats can support viable populations over time and how they compare to less modified, remnant habitats. We investigated the capacity for novel habitats to support an endangered mammal, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus obesulus: Peramelidae), in a highly-modified landscape near Australia's second largest city, Melbourne. We compared bandicoot abundance and body condition between five novel and two remnant sites, and examined whether novel sites support residency and key demographic processes necessary for bandicoot population persistence. We found that bandicoot abundance was higher at novel than remnant sites, with the highest abundance at the novel site with the most urbanised surroundings. Female body condition was similar between novel and remnant sites. The majority of bandicoots at novel sites were resident, and breeding activity, recruitment of first-year adults, and survival of mature adults were observed at all novel sites. Our results demonstrate the potential significance of novel habitats for conserving threatened species within heavily-modified landscapes, and encourage us not to judge the quality of habitats on their novelty alone. Broadening our appreciation of the potential value of novel ecosystems could increase off-reserve species conservation opportunities, a key priority within the context of the Anthropocene and unprecedented global change and biodiversity loss.},

Many alternative standards currently compete to do just that--a situation reminiscent of the early days of the Internet, when computers and networks came in multiple incompatible types. To eliminate this technological Tower of Babel, the data protocol that is at the heart of the Internet can be adopted to represent information in whatever form it takes: pulsed electrically, flashed optically, clicked acoustically, broadcast electromagnetically or printed mechanically. Using this "Internet-0" encoding, the original idea of linking computer networks into a seamless whole--the "Inter" in "Internet"--can be extended to networks of all types of devices, a concept known as interdevice internetworking. The solution to building a global network out of heterogeneous local networks, called internetworking, was found in two big ideas. The first was packet switching. The second idea was the "end-to-end" principle.},

While the first cause can be considered as a slow process, the growing presence of humans is leading to rapid aging of coasts. The Mediterranean Sea authorities are focusing on the necessity for a systematic and comprehensive approach to the management of littoral areas. In this context, Italy is searching for a promising solution to safeguard coasts but, at the same time, to manage in an intelligent and 'green' way the big amount of tourists. Research communities all over the world indicated the Internet of Things (IoT) as a valid technology to develop solutions in order to try solving or mitigating the coastal erosion problem. IoT-based techniques allow to manage heterogeneous and massive data for real-time monitoring and decision making and can be used for coastal environment and crowd level monitoring. This article presents a monitoring system based on the Social IoT (SIoT), a new paradigm that defines a network where every node is an object capable of establishing the social relationships with other things in an autonomous way according to specific rules. Thanks to social relationships, all involved devices in the monitoring system (i.e., sensors, cameras, and smartphones) are able to collect and exchange information. The proposed system, developed and installed in Cagliari (Italy), is able to evaluate the occupational state of a beach considering environmental and crowding data collected by devices and feedback sent by users.},

Reducing emissions of particulate matter not only has an instant effect on air quality, but also moderates climate change. By controlling the environmental pollution, the cities are devoid of health issues and other harmful effects. Further by using the technologies of Internet of Things and cloud computing, the measured sensor values are suggested to store in cloud storage and communicated to the authorities.

   abstract = {Social distancing in public spaces plays a crucial role in controlling or slowing down the spread of coronavirus during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Visual Social Distancing (VSD) offers an opportunity for real-time measuring and analysing the physical distance between pedestrians using surveillance videos in public spaces. It potentially provides new evidence for implementing effective prevention measures of the pandemic. The existing VSD methods developed in the literature are primarily based on frame-by-frame pedestrian detection, addressing the VSD problem from a static and local perspective. In this paper, we propose a new online multi-pedestrian tracking approach for spatio-temporal trajectory and its application to multi-scale social distancing measuring and analysis. Firstly, an online multi-pedestrian tracking method is proposed to obtain the trajectories of pedestrians in public spaces, based on hierarchical data association. Then, a new VSD method based on sptatio-temporal trajectories is proposed. The proposed method not only considers the Euclidean distance between tracking objects frame-by-frame but also takes into account the discrete Fréchet distance between trajectories, hence forms a comprehensive solution from both static and dynamic, local and holistic perspectives. We evaluated the performance of the proposed tracking method using the public dataset MOT16 benchmark. We also collected our own pedestrian dataset “SCU-VSD” and designed a multi-scale VSD analysis scheme for benchmarking the performance of the social distancing monitoring in the crowd. Experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method achieved outstanding performance on the analysis of social distancing.},

   abstract = {Physical distancing, as a measure to contain the spreading of Covid-19, is defining a “new normal”. Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: “in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?”, “Are there repeated offenders?”, and “How are new crowd management measures performing?”. Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.},

The majority of governments and national health authorities have set the 2-m physical distancing as a mandatory safety measure in shopping centres, schools and other covered areas. In this research, we develop a hybrid Computer Vision and YOLOv4-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for automated people detection in the crowd in indoor and outdoor environments using common CCTV security cameras. The proposed DNN model in combination with an adapted inverse perspective mapping (IPM) technique and SORT tracking algorithm leads to a robust people detection and social distancing monitoring. The model has been trained against two most comprehensive datasets by the time of the research—the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) and Google Open Image datasets. The system has been evaluated against the Oxford Town Centre dataset (including 150,000 instances of people detection) with superior performance compared to three state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation has been conducted in challenging conditions, including occlusion, partial visibility, and under lighting variations with the mean average precision of 99.8% and the real-time speed of 24.1 fps. We also provide an online infection risk assessment scheme by statistical analysis of the spatio-temporal data from people’s moving trajectories and the rate of social distancing violations. We identify high-risk zones with the highest possibility of virus spread and infection. This may help authorities to redesign the layout of a public place or to take precaution actions to mitigate high-risk zones. The developed model is a generic and accurate people detection and tracking solution that can be applied in many other fields such as autonomous vehicles, human action recognition, anomaly detection, sports, crowd analysis, or any other research areas where the human detection is in the centre of attention.},

While the transition from laminar to stop-and-go flows supports a recent model of bottleneck flows, the subsequent transition to turbulent flow is not yet well understood. It is responsible for sudden eruptions of pressure release comparable to earthquakes, which cause sudden displacements and the falling and trampling of people.

State-of-the-art methods for intelligent pedestrian surveillance have a number of limitations in automating and deriving useful information of high-density pedestrian traffic (HDPT) using closed circuit television (CCTV) images. This work introduces an automatic and improved HDPT surveillance system by integrating and optimizing multiple computational steps to predict pedestrian distribution from input video frames. A fast and efficient particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique is proposed to yield pedestrian velocities. A machine learning regressor model, boosted Ferns, is used to improve pedestrian count and density estimation: an essential metric for HDPT analysis. A camera perspective model is proposed to improve the speed and position estimates of HDPT by projecting 2D image pixels to 3D world-coordinate dat. All these functional improvements in HDPT velocity and displacement estimations are used as inputs to a sophisticated pedestrian flow evolution model, PEDFLOW to predict HDPT distribution at a future time point, which is a crucial information for pedestrian traffic management. The predicted and simulated HDPT properties (density, velocity) obtained using the proposed framework show low errors when compared to the ground truth data. The proposed framework is computationally efficient, suitable for multiple camera feeds with HDPT videos, and capable of rapidly analyzing and predicting flows of thousands of pedestrians. The paper shows one of the first steps towards fully integrated CCTV-based automated HDPT management system.},

Therefore, more valuable information than crowd density can be obtained. There are two major steps in this system: recognition of the head-like contour and estimation of crowd size. First, the Haar wavelet transform (HWT) is used to extract the featured area of the head-like contour, and then the support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify these featured area as the contour of a head or not. Next, the perspective transforming technique of computer vision is used to estimate crowd size more accurately. Finally, a model world is constructed to test this proposed system and the system is also applied for real-world images.},

The estimations of crowd densities are given in terms of the classification of the input images in five classes of densities (very low, low, moderate, high and very high). Three types of classifiers are used: neural (implemented according to the Kohonen model), Bayesian, and an approach based on fitting functions.

of 185,000 people. We detected 37.5% of the population, analysed their
arrival and departure behaviours, identified their smartphone
manufacturers and extracted their transition patterns from one
sub-location to another. By presenting valuable insights on the mobility
of our target crowd, we validated the potential of our platform for
crowd mobility analysis.},

   abstract = {We introduce mobile agents for mobile crowdsensing. Crowdsensing campaigns are designed through different roles that are implemented as mobile agents. The role-based tasks of mobile agents include collecting data, analyzing data and sharing data in the campaign. Mobile agents execute and control the campaign autonomously as a multi-agent system and migrate in the opportunistic network of participants’ devices. Mobile agents take into account the available resources in the devices and match participants’ privacy requirements to the campaign requirements. Sharing of task results in real-time facilitates cooperation towards the campaign goal while maintaining a selected global measure, such as energy efficiency. We discuss current challenges in crowdsensing and propose mobile agent based solutions for campaign execution and monitoring, addressing data collection and participant-related issues. We present a software framework for mobile agents-based crowdsensing that is seamlessly integrated into the Web. A set of simulations are conducted to compare mobile agent-based campaigns with existing crowdsensing approaches. We implemented and evaluated a small-scale real-world mobile agent based campaign for pedestrian flock detection. The simulation and evaluation results show that mobile agent based campaigns produce comparable results with less energy consumption when the number of agents is relatively small and enables in-network data processing with sharing of data and task results with insignificant overhead.},

   abstract = {Human population growth and urbanisation are putting pressure on urban green and blue spaces worldwide. These spaces provide habitat for biodiversity and, as evidence from the Global North shows, can provide health and wellbeing benefits to urban dwellers. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the wellbeing benefits associated with urban green and blue spaces from the Global South, where the fastest rates of population growth and urban expansion are occurring. Here, we examine green and blue spaces in Georgetown, Guyana, exploring whether frequency and duration of use is (1) associated with nature-relatedness, safety concerns, and sociodemographic characteristics, (2) associated with specific visit motivations (e.g. physical, cognitive, social), and (3) associated with wellbeing (positive and negative experiential, evaluative, eudaimonic, and mental wellbeing). Participants (n = 512) were more likely to visit green and blue spaces if they had higher nature-relatedness, no safety concerns, aged <35 years, and educated above secondary level. Visit frequency was not related to wellbeing. Visit duration did not differentiate according to visit motivations. Visits to green and blue spaces of more than 25 min were associated with increased positive experiential wellbeing. No comparable patterns were found for the other wellbeing dimensions. These findings can inform public health campaigns targeted at specific sociodemographic groups. Moreover, decision-makers could minimise health inequalities by incorporating new green and blue spaces into future development plans (including the provision of backyards), and enhancing existing spaces (e.g. reducing people's safety concerns). These measures will help maximise wellbeing across all sectors of society.},

We hypothesised that children and adolescents living in greener areas would have better quality and more sufficient levels of sleep on average, especially within the context of high traffic noise exposure. These hypotheses were tested using multilevel logistic regressions fitted on samples from the nationally representative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (10–11 years old, n = 3469, and 14–15 years old, n = 2814) and the GINIplus and LISA cohorts (10 years old, n = 1461, and 15 years old, n = 4172) from the Munich, Wesel, and Leipzig areas of Germany. Questionnaire-based binary indicators of sleep sufficiency and sleep quality in each cohort were assessed with respect to objectively measured green space exposures adjusting for age, sex, and maternal education. Models were augmented with proxy measures of traffic noise and two-way interaction terms to test for effect modification. Cross-tabulations illustrated little convincing evidence of association between green space and insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality in either sample, except for insufficient sleep among 10 year old participants in Germany. These null findings were replicated in adjusted models. The proxy for traffic noise was associated with poor quality sleep in 15 year old participants in Germany, but no convincing evidence of modified association with green space was observed.},

   abstract = {The effects of noise reduction of six tree belts were examined. An amplifier was placed in front of each tree belt, while a noise meter was placed at various heights and distances behind the tree belt. Net noise reduction effect termed as "relative attenuation" was obtained by subtracting the sound pressure level at each measurement site behind the tree belt from the sound pressure level at equal distances over open ground. Five parameters, including visibility, height, and width of the tree belt, height of receiver and noise source, and the distance between noise source and receiver, were studied. A multiple regression model demonstrating the order of importance of the five parameters in relation to relative attenuation was developed. The five parameters were then transformed into three-dimensionless parameters, i.e., h′: receiver and noise source height/tree height, d′: distance between noise source and receiver/tree height, and m′: belt width/visibility. By plotting the relative attenuation on the coordinate axis of h′, d′ and m′ and curve fitting, a three-dimensionless map of noise reduction by tree belts was formed. The map can be used as guidance in designing three belts for noise reduction in environmental planning. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Although some research has investigated the composition of services in dynamic ad hoc settings, it is not clear how service composites manage the conflict between application layer complexities and network unreliability that may cause them to fail repeatedly. This paper outlines investigations on opportunistic service composition as a solution for managing complex service requests in mobile infrastructure-less environments. Opportunistic service composition dynamically transfers control among service providers to bind and execute services in a decentralised way. Unlike existing fragmentation and broker-based designs, it interleaves provider allocation with service execution to counteract mobility in a flexible manner. Early simulation results suggest that this approach reduces the failure probability and communication overhead of complex service requests. This illustrates that opportunistic service composition may be feasible to manage collaboration in dynamic ad hoc environments. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

We believe that sensor networks have reached an important crossroads in their development. The question we address in this paper is how to propel sensor networks from their small-scale application-specific network origins, into the commercial mainstream of people's every day lives; the challenge being: how do we develop large-scale general-purpose sensor networks for the general public (e.g., consumers) capable of supporting a wide variety of applications in urban settings (e.g., enterprises, hospitals, recreational areas, towns, cities, and the metropolis). We propose MetroSense, a new people-centric paradigm for urban sensing at the edge of the Internet, at very large scale. We discuss a number of challenges, interactions and characteristics in urban sensing applications, and then present the MetroSense architecture which is based fundamentally on three design principles: network symbiosis, asymmetric design, and localized interaction. The ability of MetroSense to scale to very large areas is based on the use of an opportunistic sensor networking approach. Opportunistic sensor networking leverages mobility-enabled interactions and provides coordination between people-centric mobile sensors, static sensors and edge wireless access nodes in support of opportunistic sensing, opportunistic tasking, and opportunistic data collection. We discuss architectural challenges including providing sensing coverage with sparse mobile sensors, how to hand off roles and responsibilities between sensors, improving network performance and connectivity using adaptive multihop, and importantly, providing security and privacy for people-centric sensors and data. ©2006 ACM.},

   abstract = {Gaining insights into pedestrian flow operations and assessment tools for pedestrian walking speeds and comfort is important in for instance planning and geometric design of infrastructural facilities. Additionally, management of pedestrian flows requires knowledge of pedestrian flow behavior. However, compared to vehicular traffic, pedestrian flow operations are very complex. This is why vehicular flow simulation modeling approaches are generally not applicable to pedestrian flows. Motivated by the need for accurate pedestrian flow models, this report presents an integral theory and models for pedestrian activity scheduling, path determination in the twodimensional space, and walking behavior, under the assumption of utility optimization. In the theory put forward, pedestrians are assumed to make a simultaneous choice of the optimal activity pattern and path, on the one hand optimizing the utility of the activities, while on the other hand minimizing the cost of walking to reach the activity areas. In doing so, we formulate the pedestrian wayfinding problem as an optimal control problem in continuous time and space, where pedestrians aim to walk to the respective activity areas, while optimizing some trade-off between travel time, discomfort due to walking too close to obstacles and walking too quickly. At the same time, both the order in which the activities are performed (as far as their order is free), as well as whether an activity is performed at all, is optimized as well. Given that the pedestrian has determined both the optimal activity pattern as well as the optimal path, we postulate that pedestrian behavior at the operational level is also a result of a utility optimization process. At this level, pedestrians minimize the cost incurred while straying from the planned path, walking too close to other pedestrians, and cost due to large accelerations and decelerations. By applying calculus of variations, explicit mathematical relations are derived describing the acceleration, direction changing, and interaction behavior of a pedestrian. Throughout the report, the theory and models are illustrated by application examples.},

In the two-pass scheme of detecting pedestrians from the foreground layer: shape cue is first used to eliminate non-pedestrian moving objects and then appearance cue helps to locate the exact position of pedestrians. Templates with varying sizes are sequentially applied to detect pedestrians at multiple scales to accommodate different camera distances. To facilitate the task of pedestrian tracking, we formulate the problem of shot segmentation and present a graph matching-based tracking algorithm that jointly exploits the shape, appearance and distance information.

   abstract = {Nighttime driving is more dangerous than daytime driving-particularly for senior drivers. Three to four times as many driving-related deaths occur at night than in the daytime. To improve the safety of night driving, automatic pedestrian detection based on infrared images has drawn increased attention because pedestrians tend to stand out more against the background in infrared images than they do in visible light images. Nevertheless, pedestrian detection in infrared images is by no means trivial-many of the known difficulties carry over from visible light images, such as image variability occasioned by pedestrians being in different poses. Typically, several different pedestrian templates have to be used in order to deal with a range of poses. Furthermore, pedestrian detection is difficult because of poor infrared image quality (low resolution, low contrast, few distinguishable feature points, little texture information, etc.) and misleading signals. To address these problems, this paper introduces a shape-independent pedestrian-detection method. Our segmentation algorithm first estimates pedestrians' horizontal locations through projection-based horizontal segmentation and then determines pedestrians' vertical locations through brightness/bodyline-based vertical segmentation. Our classification method defines multidimensional histogram-, inertia-, and contrast-based classification features. The features are shape-independent, complementary to one another, and capture the statistical similarities of image patches containing pedestrians with different poses. Thus, our pedestrian-detection system needs only one pedestrian template-corresponding to a generic walking pose-and avoids brute-force searching for pedestrians throughout whole images, which typically involves brightness-similarity comparisons between candidate image patches and a multiplicity of pedestrian templates. Our pedestrian-detection system is neither based on tracking nor does it depend on camera calibration to determine the relationship between an object's height and its vertical image locations. Thus, it is less restricted in applicability. Even if much work is still needed to bridge the gap between present pedestrian-detection performance and the high reliability required for real-world applications, our pedestrian-detection system is straightforward and provides encouraging results in improving speed, reliability, and simplicity. © 2004 IEEE.},

Three main application fields have been individuated and discussed: video surveillance, human-machine interaction and analysis. Due to the large variety of acquisition technologies, this paper discusses both the differences between 2D and 3D vision systems, and indoor and outdoor systems. The authors reserved a dedicated section for the analysis of the Deep Learning methodologies, including the Convolutional Neural Networks in pedestrian detection and tracking, considering their recent exploding adoption for such a kind systems. Finally, focusing on the classification point of view, different Machine Learning techniques have been analysed, basing the discussion on the classification performances on different benchmark datasets. The reported results highlight the importance of testing pedestrian detection systems on different datasets to evaluate the robustness of the computed groups of features used as input to classifiers.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a real-time system for pedestrian tracking in sequences of grayscale images acquired by a stationary camera. The objective is to integrate this system with a traffic control application such as a pedestrian control scheme at intersections. The proposed approach can also be used to detect and track humans in front of vehicles. Furthermore, the proposed schemes can be employed for the detection of several diverse traffic objects of interest (vehicles, bicycles, etc.) The system outputs the spatio-temporal coordinates of each pedestrian during the period the pedestrian is in the scene. Processing is done at three levels: raw images, blobs, and pedestrians. Blob tracking is modeled as a graph optimization problem. Pedestrians are modeled as rectangular patches with a certain dynamic behavior. Kalman filtering is used to estimate pedestrian parameters. The system was implemented on a Datacube MaxVideo 20 equipped with a Datacube Max860 and was able to achieve a peak performance of over 30 frames per second. Experimental results based on indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrated the system's robustness under many difficult situations such as partial or full occlusions of pedestrians.},

In this paper, we present a fast and robust algorithm for detecting pedestrians in a cluttered scene from a pair of moving cameras. This is achieved through stereo-based segmentation and neural network-based recognition. The algorithm includes three steps. First, we segment the image into sub-image object candidates using disparities discontinuity. Second, we merge and split the sub-image object candidates into sub-images that satisfy pedestrian size and shape constrains. Third, we use intensity gradients of the candidate sub-images as input to a trained neural network for pedestrian recognition. The experiments on a large number of urban street scenes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm: 1) can detect pedestrians in various poses, shapes, sizes, clothing, and occlusion status; 2) runs in real-time; and 3) is robust to illumination and background changes.},

In this model, we view pedestrians as decision-making agents who consider a plethora of personal, social, and environmental factors to decide where to go next. We formulate prediction of pedestrian behavior as an energy minimization on this model. Two of our main contributions are simple, yet effective estimates of pedestrian destination and social relationships (groups). Our final contribution is to incorporate these hidden properties into an energy formulation that results in accurate behavioral prediction. We evaluate both our estimates of destination and grouping, as well as our accuracy at prediction and tracking against state of the art behavioral model and show improvements, especially in the challenging observational situation of infrequent appearance observations-something that might occur in thousands of webcams available on the Internet. © 2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Optimal escape theory predicts that animals should moderate their flight responses according to the level of risk represented by a potential predator. This theory should apply even when organisms are habituated to disturbance, and how animals respond to human presence is likely to determine their success exploiting urban habitats. Therefore, urban animals should be sensitive to cues that inform them about levels of risk, allowing them to reduce costs by not overreacting to innocuous stimuli, while ensuring that they are nevertheless reactive to genuinely threatening stimuli. We tested this at a highly urbanized site in New York City, where eastern grey squirrels appear to pay little attention to humans. Squirrels were approached tangentially on a trajectory that took the observer within ∼2m of them and we measured alert distance, flight initiation distance (FID), and distance fled for each focal individual. Squirrels showed little sign of being alerted to the pedestrian if he remained on the footpath and did not look at them (only 5% of individuals moved away), but 90% of squirrels moved away, with longer FID and flight distance, when approached by a pedestrian that moved off the footpaths and looked at them. Squirrels therefore modulate their reactions when pedestrians behave in a predictable manner (i.e. remaining on the footpaths) and are also sensitive to the direction of attention of humans, reducing unnecessary responses, and are thereby likely to be increasing their ability to persist in this urban environment. Previous studies have emphasized the behavioural plasticity of successful urban wildlife species. In this study, we emphasize the importance of disturbance monitoring by successful urban exploiters, allowing them to vary their behavioural responses according to the level of risk to which they are exposed.},

   abstract = {Urban sidewalks are of primary importance in a city environment, allowing for pedestrian flow distribution, and making up for an essential component of every city. Yet, pedestrian sidewalks have to live together with other transportation channels, like streets, and the result is that they tend to be seen as secondary with respect to traffic in most parts of the cities. The result of this policy is that the detection of their actual status, and corresponding maintenance, is often far from optimal. In this study we tackle the problem of monitoring pedestrian sidewalks, in order to promptly and effectively handle their maintenance. Following the Smart Cheap City (SCC) approach, we design and implement a system of sensors that allows to gather pedestrian data by staying within a very limited budget. We then show how this raw data can be turned into valuable information about the actual pedestrian flows, and then investigate the relationship between this flow information and the problem of sidewalks monitoring. We experiment with the system in a real city context, using various configurations, and show the effectiveness of the method when used on the field. The overall lesson is that the problem of sidewalks monitoring, and related maintenance, can be faced even when employing very limited resources, therefore allowing for a better handling of these transportation channels even when dealing with large urban areas.},

While natural areas in urban environments may provide habitat for declining groups of birds, little is known about effects of urbanization on the reproductive success of birds, such as grassland birds, that are typically thought to be associated with more rural landscapes. While typical conservation efforts have focused on conserving large patches of grassland in landscapes containing minimal amounts of woody vegetation and development, the assumption that habitat located in developed landscapes is of poor quality has not been tested and may wrongly devalue grasslands located in an urban matrix. To examine the influence of development on habitat quality for grassland birds, we studied grassland bird nest predation and brood parasitism in patches of varying size along an urbanization gradient in northeastern Illinois. Because nest predation is the primary cause of reproductive failure and a potentially limiting factor for grassland bird populations, we used miniature video cameras to identify predators at a subset of nests. From 2012 to 2013, we monitored 432 nests of 16 grassland bird species. Nest predation rates decreased with urbanization in the landscape as did probability of brood parasitism. We filmed 44 nests and documented 19 predation events. We found that coyotes Canis latrans, white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus and thirteen-lined ground squirrels Ictidomys tridecemlineatus were important nest predators in our study system. Contrary to prior assumptions, our results suggest that grasslands located in urban landscapes may provide habitat of equal or greater quality than many rural grasslands.},

   abstract = {Animal movement can be significantly altered in human-dominated landscapes such as urban and peri-urban areas, where habitat is often fragmented and/or linear. Knowledge regarding how wildlife respond to anthropogenic change is vital for informing conservation efforts in such landscapes, including the design of nature reserves and wildlife corridors. To better understand how threatened species persist and behave within human-dominated landscapes, we examined the home range and space use of the nationally endangered southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus obesulus in peri-urban Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city. Specifically, we examined whether: (1) bandicoots were confined to linear strips of remnant vegetation or also made use of the broader highly modified landscape matrix; (2) the configuration of the linear vegetated strips affected home range shape; and (3) home range area differed between bandicoots living in linear strips and those in larger remnant habitat patches. We found that: (1) 71% of adult males and 33% of adult females used the matrix, but non-dispersing juveniles were entirely confined to the linear strips; males also travelled greater distances into the matrix (away from the vegetated strips) than females; (2) bandicoots had longer home ranges in narrower strips and males had longer home ranges than females; and (3) home range area for both sexes was smaller in linear strips than has been recorded in other studies in larger remnant habitats. Our study highlights the importance of retaining narrow, fragmented and modified vegetation to accommodate threatened biodiversity within human-dominated landscapes, but suggests the surrounding matrix may also offer important resources for adaptable species, such as bandicoots. Supporting off-reserve conservation of biodiversity in novel ecosystems is increasingly pertinent in our rapidly urbanizing world.},

   abstract = {Understanding how fundamental aspects of species’ ecology, such as diet, are affected in human-dominated landscapes is vital for informing management and conserving biodiversity – particularly where species influence important ecosystem functions. Digging, mycophagous (‘fungus-eating’) mammals play various such roles, including the dispersal of hypogeal (‘truffle-like’) fungi. The endangered, mycophagous southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus obesulus: Peramelidae) persists in a peri-urban landscape south-east of Melbourne, Australia, where it occupies both ‘novel’ habitats (linear strips of vegetation along roadsides, drains and railway lines) and ‘remnant’ habitats (larger blocks of native vegetation) within dedicated conservation areas. It remains unknown how bandicoot diet, including the diversity of hypogeal fungi, varies between these habitat types, yet this could have important conservation implications. Our study aimed to (i) compare the diet of I. o. obesulus at novel and remnant sites; and (ii) attain knowledge of hypogeal fungal diversity in these different contexts. We collected 133 bandicoot scats over 23 months and examined both broad diet composition and diversity of fungi consumed. Bandicoot diet differed between site types; in particular, ants were more prominent in scats from remnant sites, while millipedes and seeds were more prominent in scats from novel sites. All scats contained fungal spores, with hypogeal taxa comprising at least 35 of the 78 ‘morphotypes’ found at novel sites and 28 of the 59 detected at remnant sites. Fewer samples were collected at remnant sites, but they appeared to contain a greater richness of hypogeal fungi per scat. We did not detect any differences in fungal composition between site types. However, our sampling effort was insufficient to estimate true morphotype richness at either site type. Our study highlights the adaptable generalist diet of the southern brown bandicoot, as well as the likely under-appreciated diversity of hypogeal fungi that can occur in highly modified, novel ecosystems.},

   abstract = {The influence of predators on bird populations is controversial and poorly understood, especially in urban areas where predator densities can be particularly high. We assessed if fine-scale spatial variation in predator activity and proximity have direct and indirect effects on urban songbird distributions and breeding success, by testing the hypotheses that (1) songbirds that are sensitive to nest predation select territories with reduced activity of nest predators; (2) blackbird Turdus merula, a species that experiences high nest predation rates, lays smaller clutches in territories located in areas with higher numbers of nest predators as predicted by Skutch's hypothesis; (3) songbirds that are sensitive to nest predation have higher nest predation rates in areas with greater predator activity. We tested these hypotheses using two sites in urban Sheffield, UK, and focus on nest predatory corvids and grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis. We found no evidence that songbirds that are most sensitive to nest predation adjust their territory location in response to fine-scale spatial variation in predator distributions. It thus seems unlikely that urban predators are indirectly regulating urban bird population size by restricting habitat availability. Blackbirds did not vary their clutch size in response to predator distributions. These findings generate the potential for an ecological trap in which prey species fail to avoid areas with the highest concentrations of nest predators, or to exhibit behavioural adjustments to reduce the risk of nest predation at such sites. We find some evidence for such ecological traps as, while fine-scale variation in grey squirrel occurrence and activity were not associated with nest predation rates, nests located in closer proximity to corvids and in areas with higher indices of corvid activity experienced slightly higher nest predation rates.},

Nevertheless, a few species appear to thrive in the evolutionarily novel environment created by cities, demonstrating the remarkable adaptability of some animals. We argue that individuals that can adjust their behaviours to the new selection pressures presented by cities should have greater success in urban habitats. Accordingly, urban wildlife often exhibit behaviours that differ from those of their rural counterparts, from changes to food and den preferences to adjustments in the structure of their signals. Research suggests that behavioural flexibility (or phenotypic plasticity) may be an important characteristic for succeeding in urban environments. Moreover, some individuals or species might possess behavioural traits (a particular temperament) that are inherently well suited to occupying urban habitats, such as a high level of disturbance tolerance. This suggests that members of species that are less 'plastic' or naturally timid in temperament are likely to be disadvantaged in high-disturbance environments and consequently may be precluded from colonizing cities and towns. © 2012 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

   abstract = {Cities may represent one of the most challenging environments for carnivorous mammals. For example, cities have a dearth of vegetation and other natural resources, coupled with increased habitat fragmentation and an abundance of roads as well as altered climate (e.g. temperature, light, rainfall and water runoff). It is therefore intriguing that several carnivore species have become established in cities across the globe. Medium-sized carnivores such as the red fox, coyote, Eurasian badger and raccoon not only survive in cities but also have managed to exploit anthropogenic food sources and shelter to their significant advantage, achieving higher population densities than are found under natural conditions. In addition, although they may not live permanently within cities, even large carnivores such as bears, wolves and hyaenas derive significant benefit from living adjacent to urbanized areas. In this review, we examine the history of urban adaptation by mammalian carnivores, explore where they are living, what they eat, what kills them and the behavioural consequences of living in urban areas. We review the biology of urban carnivores, exploring traits such as body size and dietary flexibility. Finally, we consider the consequences of having populations of carnivores in urbanized areas, both for humans and for these charismatic mammals. In conclusion, in a time of massive environmental change across the globe, the continuing encroachment of urbanization upon wilderness areas is substantially reducing the availability of natural habitats for many species; therefore, understanding the biology of any taxon that is able to adapt to and exploit anthropogenically disturbed systems must aid us in both controlling and developing suitable conservation measures for the future of such species. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.},

   abstract = {The initial response of individuals to human-induced environmental change is often behavioural. This can improve the performance of individuals under sudden, large-scale perturbations and maintain viable populations. The response can also give additional time for genetic changes to arise and, hence, facilitate adaptation to new conditions. On the other hand, maladaptive responses, which reduce individual fitness, may occur when individuals encounter conditions that the population has not experienced during its evolutionary history, which can decrease population viability. A growing number of studies find human disturbances to induce behavioural responses, both directly and by altering factors that influence fitness. Common causes of behavioural responses are changes in the transmission of information, the concentration of endocrine disrupters, the availability of resources, the possibility of dispersal, and the abundance of interacting species. Frequent responses are alterations in habitat choice, movements, foraging, social behaviour and reproductive behaviour. Behavioural responses depend on the genetically determined reaction norm of the individuals, which evolves over generations. Populations first respond with individual behavioural plasticity, whereafter changes may arise through innovations and the social transmission of behavioural patterns within and across generations, and, finally, by evolution of the behavioural response over generations. Only a restricted number of species show behavioural adaptations that make them thrive in severely disturbed environments. Hence, rapid human-induced disturbances often decrease the diversity of native species, while facilitating the spread of invasive species with highly plastic behaviours. Consequently, behavioural responses to human-induced environmental change can have profound effects on the distribution, adaptation, speciation and extinction of populations and, hence, on biodiversity. A better understanding of the mechanisms of behavioural responses and their causes and consequences could improve our ability to predict the effects of human-induced environmental change on individual species and on biodiversity. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {Urban green spaces (GS) are essential for the well-being of the population. Several works have shown a positive correlation between the amount of GS and the household incomes in both developed and developing countries. Thus, the higher the incomes, the larger the total area covered by GS, the better the quality of these spaces, the higher the amount of private GS. Public policies seek to correct this inequality, but existing indicators, especially the amount of GS per inhabitant, do not provide enough information for effective decision-making. Our aim was to provide tools to evaluate and plan better the location and quality of GS in complex urban areas. For this we applied a set of indicators for GS at two spatial scales city-level and local-level, in order to disclose existing inequalities. The indicators considered (i) the total area of GS in relation to population and urban context, (ii) the quality of GS based on its size, shape and vegetation cover, and (iii) the spatial distribution and accessibility of GS. The proposed indicators were tested in three municipalities, belonging to the Metropolitan Area of Santiago (Chile), with different household incomes. The indicators showed large differences in terms of quantity of GS per inhabitant, vegetation cover and accessibility. The GS proved to be an effective strategy to reduce areas that lack vegetation cover. The sustainability assessments must consider how the diversity of structural attributes of GS has an impact on the well-being of urban inhabitants.},

Some mammalian species have adapted to these novel environments, but it remains unclear which characteristics allow them to persist. To address this question, we identified 190 mammals regularly recorded in urban settlements worldwide, and used phylogenetic path analysis to test hypotheses regarding which behavioural, ecological and life history traits favour adaptation to urban environments for different mammalian groups. Our results show that all urban mammals produce larger litters; whereas other traits such as body size, behavioural plasticity and diet diversity were important for some but not all taxonomic groups. This variation highlights the idiosyncrasies of the urban adaptation process and likely reflects the diversity of ecological niches and roles mammals can play. Our study contributes towards a better understanding of mammal association to humans, which will ultimately allow the design of wildlife-friendly urban environments and contribute to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.},

   abstract = {The paper proposes a novel approach for direction estimation of a moving pedestrian as perceived in a 2-D coordinate of field camera. The proposed direction estimation method is intended for pedestrian monitoring in traffic control systems. Apart from traffic control, direction of motion estimation is also very important in accident avoidance system for smart cars, assisted living systems, in occlusion prediction for seamless tracking in visual surveillance, and so on. The proposed video-based direction estimation method exploits the notion of perspective distortion as perceived in monocular vision of 2-D camera co-ordinate. The temporal pattern of change in dimension of pedestrian in a frame sequence is unique for each direction; hence, the dimensional change-based feature is used to estimate the direction of motion; eight discrete directions of motion are considered and the hidden Markov model is used for classification. The experiments are conducted over CASIA Dataset A, CASIA Dataset B, and over a self-acquired dataset: NITR Conscious Walk Dataset. The balanced accuracy of direction estimation for these experiments yields satisfactory results with accuracy indices as 94.58%, 90.87%, and 95.83%, respectively. The experiment also justifies with suitable test conditions about the characteristic features, such as robustness toward improper segmentation, partial occlusion, and changing orientation of head or body during walk of a pedestrian. The proposed method can be used as a standalone system or can be integrated with existing frame-based direction estimation methods for implementing a pedestrian monitoring system.},

   abstract = {This paper addresses the efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication in a network composed of a large number of tags that transmit information to a single hub using advertisement mode. Theoretical results show that the use of advertisements enables hundreds and thousands of BLE devices to coexist in the same area and at the same time effectively transmit messages. Together with other properties (low power consumption, medium communication range, capability to detect a signal’s angle-of-arrival, etc.), this makes BLE a competing technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, as the number of communicating devices increases, the advertisement collision intensifies and the communication performance of BLE drops. This phenomena was so far analyzed theoretically, in simulations and in small-scale experiments, but large-scale experiments are not presented in the literature. This paper complements previous results and presents an experimental evaluation of a real IoT-use case, which is the deployment of over 200 tags communicating using advertisements. We evaluate the impact of the number of advertisements on the effective data reception rate and throughput. Despite the advertisement collision rate in our experiment varying between 0.22 and 0.33, we show that BLE, thanks to the multiple transmission of advertisements, can still ensure acceptable data reception rates and fulfill the requirements of a wide range of IoT applications.},

Such a solution could help car manufacturers develop vehicles that have better fuel economy and performance, in addition to supporting new applications. However, which wireless technology should be used for maximizing the benefits of IVWSNs is still an open issue. In this article we propose to use a new wireless technology known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and outline a new architecture for IVWSN. Based on a comprehensive study that encompasses an example application, it is shown that BLE is an excellent option that can be used in IVWSNs for certain applications mainly due to its good performance and low-power, lowcomplexity, and low-cost attributes.},

By removing the wires, car manufacturers can reduce the weight of a vehicle and improve engine performance, fuel economy, and reliability. In addition to these direct benefits, an IVWSN is a versatile platform that can support other vehicular applications as well. An example application, known as a side blind zone alert (SBZA) system, which monitors the blind zone of the vehicle and alerts the driver in a timely manner to prevent collisions, is discussed in this paper. The performance of the IVWSN-based SBZA system is evaluated via real experiments conducted on two test vehicles. Our results show that the proposed system can achieve approximately 95%-99% detection rate with less than 15% false alarm rate. Compared with commercial systems using radars or cameras, the main benefit of the IVWSN-based SBZA is substantially lower cost.},

   abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an energy-efficient radio communication technology that is rapidly gaining popularity for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. While BLE was not designed specifically with vehicular communications in mind, its simple and quick connection establishment mechanisms make BLE a potential inter-vehicle communication technology, either replacing or complementing other vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technologies (such as the yet to be deployed DSRC). In this paper we propose a framework for V2V communication using BLE and evaluate its performance under various configurations. BLE uses two major methods for data transmission: (1) undirected advertisements and scanning (unconnected mode) and (2) using the central and peripheral modes of the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) connection (connected mode). This paper investigates quantitative and qualitative advantages and disadvantages of both approaches and proposes a communication framework based on the central/peripheral mode, which uses a random role switching technique to ensure frequent communication opportunities between devices. Further, experiments on BLE-equipped Android devices are used to study the impacts of different framework parameters on communication performance, loss rates, and scalability. The paper further discusses other limitations, prospects, and potential applications of a BLE-based communication framework for VANETs.},

   abstract = {Appliance load monitoring in smart homes has been gaining importance due to its significant advantages in achieving an energy efficient smart grid. The methods to manage such processes can be classified into hardware-based methods, including intrusive load monitoring (ILM) and software-based methods referring to non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). ILM is based on low-end meter devices attached to home appliances in opposition to NILM techniques, where only a single point of sensing is needed. Although ILM solutions can be relatively expensive, they provide higher efficiency and reliability than NILMs. Moreover, future solutions are expected to be hybrid, combining the benefits of NILM along with individual power measurement by smart plugs and smart appliances. This paper proposes a novel ILM approach for load monitoring that aims to develop an activity recognition system based on IoT architecture. The proposed IoT architecture consists of the appliances layer, perception layer, communication network layer, middleware layer, and application layer. The main function of the appliance recognition module is to label sensor data and allow the implementation of different home applications. Three different classifier models are tested using real data from the UK-DALE dataset: feed-forward neural network (FFNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and support vector machine (SVM). The developed activities of daily living (ADL) algorithm maps each ADL to a set of criteria depending on the appliance used. The features are extracted according to the consumption in Watt-hours and the times where they are switched on. In the FFNN and the LSTM networks, the accuracy is above 0.9 while around 0.8 for the SVM network. Other experiments are performed to evaluate the classifier model using a new test set. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to study the impact of the group size on the classifier accuracy.},

First, we point out that traditional smart home solution (Smart Home 1.0) only achieves the interaction between users and home appliances in indoor environment, while ignoring the relation between users and indoor greeneries. Then, we discuss the benefits of indoor greeneries for improving indoor living environment which leads a better physical health and mental health for home users. As greeneries are integrated into Smart Home 1.0, we propose an evolution from traditional smart home solution to Smart Home 2.0 to achieve the organic integration between users and greeneries. To verify our proposal, a prototype system of Smart Home 2.0 is designed and implemented. The experimental results show the smooth data flows from sensors deployed in smart green house to data center. A mobile cloud system is built to store, manage and visualize the data for the affective interaction between greeneries and home users.

Since the BLE Beacon may produce a multipath effect, this study used the positioning algorithm and hardware configuration to reduce the error rate. Location fingerprint positioning algorithm and filter modification were used to establish a positioning method for facilitating deployment, and to reduce the required computing resources. The experiments included an observation of the Received Signal Strength Indicators (RSSI) and selecting filters and a discussion of the relationship between the characteristics of the BLE Beacon signal accuracy and the number of the BLE Beacons deployed in the observation space. The BLE Beacon multilateration positioning was combined with the In-Snergy intelligent energy management system for smart home power management. The contribution of this study is to allow users to enjoy smart home services based on their location within the home using a mobile device application.},

   abstract = {Medical devices measure vital parameters such as pulse, respiration rate, and blood oxygenation, over periods of days or weeks in a continuous manner. Traditional systems only support such requirements in stationary applications where a constant power supply is available. Trends toward remote healthcare and telemedicine require wearable devices, able to provide similar functionalities in wireless mode. Miniaturized and thin form factors, desirable in wearable applications, set stringent constraints on the available power, and consequently on the accuracy and lifetime. Energy harvesting combined with low-power design and energy efficient processing can significantly extend the lifetime of wearable devices. This paper presents a wearable pulse oximeter assembled in a 3D ring-like geometry that achieves self-sustainability by exploiting efficient power management, solar energy harvesting, and ultra-low power processing in a multi-core microcontroller. The design strategy of combining onboard processing to monitor blood oxygenation and the transmission of only relevant information via a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) interface, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption. Experimental results on the designed and developed prototype demonstrate that measuring the blood oxygenation once every minute with a sampling rate of 100 samples/s achieve accurate results at the daily energy consumption of 28 J including hourly BLE transmissions. The low-power design allows the system to be self-sustainable with just 64 min of sunlight per day or 12 hrs. of indoor home light.},

Our prototype continuously monitors ambient elements (sound level, toxic gases, ultraviolet radiation, air pressure, temperature, and humidity), personal activity (motion tracking and body positioning using gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer), and vital signs (skin temperature and heart rate). An innovative three-dimensional hardware, based on the multi-physical-layer approach is introduced. Using board-to-board connectors, several physical hardware layers are stacked on top of each other. All of these layers consist of integrated and/or add-on sensors to measure certain domain (environmental, behavioral, or physiological). The prototype includes centralized data processing, transmission, and visualization. Bi-directional communication is based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and can connect to smartphones as well as smart cars and smart homes for data analytic and adverse-event alerts. This study aims to develop a prototype for simultaneous monitoring of the all three areas for monitoring of workplaces and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with a concentration on technical development and validation rather than clinical investigation. We have implemented 6 prototypes which have been tested by 5 volunteers. We have asked the subjects to test the prototype in a daily routine in both indoor (workplaces and laboratories) and outdoor. We have not imposed any specific conditions for the tests. All presented data in this work are from the same prototype. Eleven sensors measure fifteen parameters from three domains.

With this trend, new fields such as industrial IoT have arisen, which in turn have opened the doors to new possibilities that are shaping the future of industrial automation. In contrast to regular wireless networks, however, industrial applications of WSN are characterized for being time-critical systems with highly stringent requirements that challenge all available technologies. Because of its ultra-low energy properties, compatibility with most mobile units, reduced production costs, robustness and high throughput, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a potential candidate for these settings. This article explores the potential of BLE of meeting the real-time demands found in the domain of industrial process automation and industrial IoT. In order to evaluate the suitability of the protocol for these scenarios, the effect of adaptations in the retransmission scheme on the reliability and timeliness performance are thoroughly studied. Three retransmission schemes are evaluated and simulation results proved that by optimally modifying the BLE retransmission model, a maximum delay below 46 ms and a packet loss rate in the order of 10 - 5 can be obtained, enabling BLE to fulfill the requirements of even the most demanding cases within the considered range of applications.},

The BLE neighbor discovery process (NDP) based on active scanning may be the core of multiple IoT applications in which a large and varying number of users/devices/tags must be detected in a short period of time. Minimizing the discovery latency and maximizing the number of devices that can be discovered in a limited time are challenging issues due to collisions between frames sent by advertisers and scanners. The mechanism for resolution of collisions between scanners has a great impact on the achieved performance, but backoff in NDP has been poorly studied so far. This paper includes a detailed analysis of backoff in NDP, identifies and studies the factors involved in the process, reveals the limitations and problems presented by the algorithm suggested by the specifications and proposes simple and practical adaptations on scanner functionality. They are easily compatible with the current definitions of the standard, which together with a new proposal for the backoff scheme, may significantly improve the discovery latencies and, thus, the probability of discovering a large number of devices in high density scenarios.},

To address these GNSS outages, pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is commonly used due to its significant improvements in both the stability and continuity of positioning, which are dependent on three key factors: continuous absolute position, heading and step information. Signals of opportunity are commonly used in positioning, whereas the installation of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors on lampposts can provide an opportunity for positioning and heading estimation in urban canyons. In this article, a system integrating the GNSS, PDR, and BLE techniques is implemented in smartphones to provide a real-time positioning solution for pedestrians, which includes a new position correction method based on BLE heading, a reliable heading estimation integrating BLE and inertial sensors, an unconstrained step detection method with high accuracy, and an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to integrate multiple sensors and techniques. In several field experiments, with improvements in availability and robustness, the heading accuracy of the proposed fusion approach could reach approximately 3 degrees; the positioning accuracy achieved between 2.7 m and 4.2 m, compared with a 30 m error from the GNSS alone. Simultaneously, this system could achieve a high positioning accuracy of 2.4 m with unconstrained smartphones in a mixed environment. The proposed system has been demonstrated to perform well in urban canyons.},

The three main proposals are: frequency diversity, Kalman filtering and a trilateration method what we have denominated “weighted trilateration”. The analysis of the results proves that all the proposals improve the precision of the system, which goes up to 1.82 m 90% of the time for a device moving in a middle-size room and 0.7 m for static devices. Furthermore, we have proved that the system is scalable and efficient in terms of cost and power consumption. The implemented approach allows using a very simple device (like a SensorTag) on the items to locate. The system enables a very low density of anchor points or references and with a precision better than existing solutions.},

In this paper, we study the effect of BLE protocols and channels on indoor positioning using different distance and similarity measures in a controlled environment. With the aim of reproducing a real positioning system situation, we also study the effect of the user's orientation in the positioning phase and, consequently, provide accuracy and precision results for each orientation. In a 168-m2 testbed, 12 beacons configured to broadcast with the Eddystone and iBeacon protocols were deployed and 40 distance/similarity measures were considered. According to our results, in a specific orientation there is a group of distance metrics coupled with a protocol-channel combination that produces similar accuracy results. Therefore, choosing the right distance metric in that specific orientation is not as critical as choosing the right protocol and, especially, the right channel. There is a trend whereby the protocol-channel combination that provides the best accuracy is almost unique for each orientation. Depending on the orientation, the accuracies obtained for the abovementioned group of distances are within the range of 1.1-1.5 m and the precisions are 90% within the range of 1.5-2.5 m.},

The recent introduction of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio protocol provides new opportunities for indoor location. It supports portable battery-powered beacons that can be easily distributed at low cost, giving it distinct advantages over WiFi. However, its differing use of the radio band brings new challenges too. In this work, we provide a detailed study of BLE fingerprinting using 19 beacons distributed around a ∼ 600 m2 testbed to position a consumer device. We demonstrate the high susceptibility of BLE to fast fading, show how to mitigate this, and quantify the true power cost of continuous BLE scanning. We further investigate the choice of key parameters in a BLE positioning system, including beacon density, transmit power, and transmit frequency. We also provide quantitative comparison with WiFi fingerprinting. Our results show advantages to the use of BLE beacons for positioning.

   abstract = {Indoor wireless positioning using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons have attracted considerable attention from industry and academia given the many advantages of this technology such as low power consumption, low cost, easy layout, high availability, and high precision. However, the indoor positioning accuracy always suffers from non-line of sight (NLOS) propagation, stemming from the frequently occurring instances of reflection, refraction, or scattering of BLE radio signals due to the complexity of indoor environments. This article proposes an integrity monitoring (IM) algorithm to detect and eliminate two gross errors simultaneously to solve the adverse effects caused by the NLOS. The logarithmic attenuation model based on the received signal strength indication (RSSI) of BLE realizes positioning by combining trilateration and Least Squares Based on the Taylor expansion (LSBT). Furthermore, the IM based on hypothesis testing is employed to improve the positioning quality andthe users will be alerted in time to avoid risk from positioning accuracy no longer meet user's requirement. The performance of the proposed IM algorithm has been extensively tested by conducting simulation and field experiments. The experimental results show that the IM algorithm significantly improved BLE positioning accuracy as well as the robustness of the positioning system. The 90% average error (1.9143m) in seven groups of single point experiments was reduced by 34.48% over the 90% average error (2.9143m) of the LSBT method after performing IM, and the maximum error during continuous positioning did not exceed 3m after performing IM, which were better than only using LSBT positioning.},

   abstract = {Indoor wireless localization using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons has attracted considerable attention after the release of the BLE protocol. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that uses the combination of channel-separate polynomial regression model (PRM), channel-separate fingerprinting (FP), outlier detection and extended Kalman filtering (EKF) for smartphone-based indoor localization with BLE beacons. The proposed algorithm uses FP and PRM to estimate the target’s location and the distances between the target and BLE beacons respectively. We compare the performance of distance estimation that uses separate PRM for three advertisement channels (i.e., the separate strategy) with that use an aggregate PRM generated through the combination of information from all channels (i.e., the aggregate strategy). The performance of FP-based location estimation results of the separate strategy and the aggregate strategy are also compared. It was found that the separate strategy can provide higher accuracy; thus, it is preferred to adopt PRM and FP for each BLE advertisement channel separately. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the algorithm, a two-level outlier detection mechanism is designed. Distance and location estimates obtained from PRM and FP are passed to the first outlier detection to generate improved distance estimates for the EKF. After the EKF process, the second outlier detection algorithm based on statistical testing is further performed to remove the outliers. The proposed algorithm was evaluated by various field experiments. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieved the accuracy of \&lt;2.56 m at 90% of the time with dense deployment of BLE beacons (1 beacon per 9 m), which performs 35.82% better than \&lt;3.99 m from the Propagation Model (PM) + EKF algorithm and 15.77% more accurate than \&lt;3.04 m from the FP + EKF algorithm. With sparse deployment (1 beacon per 18 m), the proposed algorithm achieves the accuracies of \&lt;3.88 m at 90% of the time, which performs 49.58% more accurate than \&lt;8.00 m from the PM + EKF algorithm and 21.41% better than \&lt;4.94 m from the FP + EKF algorithm. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is especially useful to improve the localization accuracy in environments with sparse beacon deployment.},

In indoor wireless networks, these propagation conditions are very difficult to predict due to the unwieldy and dynamic nature of the RSS. In this paper, we present a novel method which dynamically estimates the propagation models that best fit the propagation environments, by using only RSS measurements obtained in real time. This method is based on maximizing compatibility of the MS to access points (AP) distance estimates. Once the propagation models are estimated in real time, it is possible to accurately determine the distance between the MS and each AP. By means of these distance estimates, the location of the MS can be obtained by trilateration. The method proposed coupled with simulations and measurements in a real indoor environment, demonstrates its feasibility and suitability, since it outperforms conventional RSS-based indoor location methods without using any radio map information nor a calibration stage. © 2010 IEEE.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based parameter tracking strategy for constrained position localization is proposed. To estimate channel model parameters, least mean squares method (LMS) is associated with the trilateration method. In the context of applications where the positions are constrained on a grid, a novel tracking strategy is proposed to determine the real position and obtain the actual parameters in the monitored region. Based on practical data acquired from a real localization system, an experimental channel model is constructed to provide RSSI values and verify the proposed tracking strategy. Quantitative criteria are given to guarantee the efficiency of the proposed tracking strategy by providing a trade-off between the grid resolution and parameter variation. The simulation results show a good behavior of the proposed tracking strategy in the presence of space-time variation of the propagation channel. Compared with the existing RSSI-based algorithms, the proposed tracking strategy exhibits better localization accuracy but consumes more calculation time. In addition, a tracking test is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking strategy.},

This is a common issue when applying the ANN to indoor fingerprinting-based localization where the signal is unstable. To date, there is not adequate feature extraction method that can significantly mitigate the influence of the receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI) variation that degrades the performance of the ANN-based indoor fingerprinting algorithm. In this work, a wavelet scattering transform is used to extract reliable features that are stable to small deformation and rotation invariant. The extracted features are used by a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the location. The zeroth and the first layer of decomposition coefficients were used as features data by concatenating different scattering path coefficients. The proposed algorithm has been validated on real measurements and has achieved good performance. The experimentation results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction method is stable to the RSSI variation.},

   abstract = {Localization is one of the current challenges in indoor navigation research. The conventional global positioning system (GPS) is affected by weak signal strengths due to high levels of signal interference and fading in indoor environments. Therefore, new positioning solutions tailored for indoor environments need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for indoor localization. However, the performance of a deep learning system depends on the quality of the feature representation. This paper introduces two novel feature set extractions based on the continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) of the received signal strength indicators’ (RSSI) data. The two novel CWT feature sets were augmented with additive white Gaussian noise. The first feature set is CWT image-based, and the second is composed of the CWT PSD numerical data that were dimensionally equalized using principal component analysis (PCA). These proposed image and numerical data feature sets were both evaluated using CNN and ANN models with the goal of identifying the room that the human subject was in and estimating the precise location of the human subject in that particular room. Extensive experiments were conducted to generate the proposed augmented CWT feature set and numerical CWT PSD feature set using two analyzing functions, namely, Morlet and Morse. For validation purposes, the performance of the two proposed feature sets were compared with each other and other existing feature set formulations. The accuracy, precision and recall results show that the proposed feature sets performed better than the conventional feature sets used to validate the study. Similarly, the mean localization error generated by the proposed feature set predictions was less than those of the conventional feature sets used in indoor localization. More particularly, the proposed augmented CWT-image feature set outperformed the augmented CWT-PSD numerical feature set. The results also show that the Morse-based feature sets trained with CNN produced the best indoor positioning results compared to all Morlet and ANN-based feature set formulations.},

   abstract = {As the demand for location services increases, research on location technology has aroused great interest. In particular, signal-based fingerprint location positioning technology has become a research hotspot owing to its high positioning performance. In general, the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) will be used as a location feature to build a fingerprint database. However, at different locations, this feature distinction may not be obvious, resulting in low positioning accuracy. Considering the wavelet transform can get valuable features from the signals, the long-term evolution (LTE) signals were converted into wavelet feature images to construct the fingerprint database. To fully extract the signal features, a two-level hierarchical structure positioning system is proposed to achieve satisfactory positioning accuracy. A deep residual network (ResNet) rough locator is used to learn useful features from the wavelet feature fingerprint image database. Then, inspired by the transfer learning idea, a fine locator based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) is leveraged to further learn the features of the wavelet fingerprint image to obtain better localization performance. Additionally, multiple data enhancement techniques were adopted to increase the richness of the fingerprint dataset, thereby enhancing the robustness of the positioning system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system leads to improved positioning performance in outdoor environments.},

With the rise of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons, i.e., platforms used to interact digitally with the real world, more standard positioning solutions are emerging in different contexts. However the reachable positioning accuracy with this technology is still unacceptable for some real applications (e.g., in the healthcare sector or the emergency management). In this paper, an hybrid localization application coupling a real time model based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) technique and the analysis of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of BLE beacons is proposed. In particular, the smartphone application is composed by three main real time threads: a model based step length estimation, heading determination and the fusion of beacon information to reset the position and the drift error of the PDR. In order to give soundness to our approach we firstly validated the step length smartphone app with a stereo-photogrammetric system.

To provide a real-time indoor position system with high precision and stability is necessary under many circumstances. In a real-time position scenario, gross errors of the Bluetooth low energy (BLE) fingerprint method are more easily occurring and the heading angle of the pedestrian will drift without acceleration and magnetic field compensation. A real-time BLE/pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR) integrated system by using an improved robust filter has been proposed. In the PDR method, the improved Mahony complementary filter based on the pedestrian motion states is adopted to estimate the heading angle reducing the drift error. Then, an improved robust filter is utilized to detect and restrain the gross error of the BLE fingerprint method. The robust filter detected the gross error at different granularity by constructing a robust vector changing the observation covariance matrix of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) adaptively when the application is running. Several experiments are conducted in the true position scenario. The mean position accuracy obtained by the proposed method in the experiment is 0.844 m and RMSE is 0.74 m. Compared with the classic EKF, these two values are increased by 38% and 18%, respectively. The results show that the improved filter can avoid the gross error in the BLE method and provide high precision and scalability in indoor position service.},

Dealing with mobility can pose some formidable challenges in protocol design, particularly, at the link and network layers. These difficulties require mobility adaption algorithms to efficiently localize mobile nodes and predict the quality of link that can be established with these nodes. An off the shelf development platform that uses Radio Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) is mostly selected as the sensor localization method, especially in the indoor environment. Despite this, not much research work has been done to practically demonstrate the reliability of RSSI for indoor localization. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to calibrate and map RSSI to distance by doing a series of experiments. The result shows that the RSSI technology gives an unacceptable high error and thus is not reliable for the indoor sensor localization.},

The proposed direction estimation method is intended for pedestrian monitoring in traffic control systems. Apart from traffic control, direction of motion estimation is also very important in accident avoidance system for smart cars, assisted living systems, in occlusion prediction for seamless tracking in visual surveillance, and so on. The proposed video-based direction estimation method exploits the notion of perspective distortion as perceived in monocular vision of 2-D camera co-ordinate. The temporal pattern of change in dimension of pedestrian in a frame sequence is unique for each direction; hence, the dimensional change-based feature is used to estimate the direction of motion; eight discrete directions of motion are considered and the hidden Markov model is used for classification. The experiments are conducted over CASIA Dataset A, CASIA Dataset B, and over a self-acquired dataset: NITR Conscious Walk Dataset. The balanced accuracy of direction estimation for these experiments yields satisfactory results with accuracy indices as 94.58%, 90.87%, and 95.83%, respectively. The experiment also justifies with suitable test conditions about the characteristic features, such as robustness toward improper segmentation, partial occlusion, and changing orientation of head or body during walk of a pedestrian. The proposed method can be used as a standalone system or can be integrated with existing frame-based direction estimation methods for implementing a pedestrian monitoring system.},

   abstract = {Pedestrian-vehicle conflicts are considered one of the most common safety problems at signalized intersections. In Japan, the pedestrian flashing green (PFG) is considered a safe time interval for pedestrians at crosswalks to finish crossing before conflicting vehicle streams are released. In most common phasing schemes, pedestrians have the right-of-way along with left-turning vehicles (in left-hand traffic). By law, pedestrians should not enter a crosswalk during the PFG. However, many of them rush into crosswalks without necessarily heeding approaching turning vehicles, which could increase the probability of severe conflicts. The objective of this paper is to analyze and model the probabilistic behavior of pedestrians after the onset of the PFG, which contains the pedestrians' decision of whether to give up crossing, as well as the pedestrian speed distribution. Empirical data analysis showed that longer crosswalks lead to significantly higher pedestrian stop probabilities. Furthermore, there is a significant difference between the pedestrians' speeds in the first and second halves of crosswalks. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation showed that the estimated models closely represent the overall stochastic behavior of the pedestrians from the onset of the PFG until the completion of crossing.},

Many countries are now generating audible signals at crossings for visually impaired people to help with this problem. However, these accessible pedestrian signals can result in confusion for visually impaired people as they do not know which signal must be interpreted for traveling multiple crosses in complex road architecture. To solve this problem, we propose an assistive system called CAS (Crossing Assistance System) which extends the principle of the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) signal for outdoor and indoor location tracking and overcomes the intrinsic limitation of outdoor noise to enable us to locate the user effectively. We installed the system on a real-world intersection and collected a set of data for demonstrating the feasibility of outdoor RSSI tracking in a series of two studies. In the first study, our goal was to show the feasibility of using outdoor RSSI on the localization of four zones. We used a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method and showed it led to 99.8% accuracy. In the second study, we extended our work to a more complex setup with nine zones, evaluated both the kNN and an additional method, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with various RSSI features for classification. We found that the SVM performed best using the RSSI average, standard deviation, median, interquartile range (IQR) of the RSSI over a 5 s window. The best method can localize people with 97.7% accuracy. We conclude this paper by discussing how our system can impact navigation for BVI users in outdoor and indoor setups and what are the implications of these findings on the design of both wearable and traffic assistive technology for blind pedestrian navigation.},

Our research work is focused on analyze the capabilities of these technologies for continuous data transmission and integration of clinical sensors in home-care and Ambient Assisted Living environments. For this purpose, this work analyses exhaustively the capabilities from BLE and compare this with the capabilities from Bluetooth 2.1. In addition, it has been considered the communications requirements from different clinical devices such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a capnograph. It is concluded that the performance from BLE is lower than Bluetooth Classic (Bluetooth 2.1) for continuous communications, since BLE is based on attributes (datapoints) transfer instead of offering a communication session where can be transmitted as much packets as required, without any size constraint. Therefore, it is necessary to perform data compression/aggregation when the amount of data to send is too large to be stored in a BLE attribute. This work also presents how to apply pre-processing techniques that greatly reduces the transmission overload (performs signal compression) in order to allow the continuous transmission of the ECG and capnograph signal through BLE making so feasible the integration of continuous clinical devices via BLE.},

   abstract = {Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) is commonly used to provide distance estimates in range-based localization. In most cases, the localization systems use RSS at short range where the distance estimates are more reliable or use RSS alongside other techniques such as Time of Flight (ToF). This is so, since RSSI measurements have relatively high variance at long range and are strongly influenced by occlusions and interference in the deployment region of the Radio Frequency (RF) devices. This paper presents an overview of common filtering techniques that can be used to process RSSI readings in order to improve the accuracy of range computation from raw RSSI with minimal computational overhead. The range estimates computed from the filtered data are compared with expected values of the perturbed range/distance expressed in terms of the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for RSS distance estimation. Results show that filtering can significantly improve the accuracy of range estimation, highlighting the pros and cons of the presented filtering methods at different range values.},

Advanced systems are required to improve and automate the crowd management system. The aim of the closed circuit television and visual monitoring systems using multiple cameras faces many challenges like illumination variance, occlusion and small spatial–temporal resolution, person in sleep, shadows, dynamic backgrounds, and noises. Therefore, the crowd monitoring, prevention of stampedes and crowd-related emergencies in the smart cities are major challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent decision computing based paradigm for crowd monitoring in the smart city. In the intelligent computing based framework, the optimization algorithm is applied to compute the feature of crowd motion and measure the correlation between agents based motion model and the crowd data using extended Kalman filtering approach and KL-divergence technique. The proposed framework measures the correlation measure based on extracted novel distinctive feature, and holistic feature of crowd data represent and to classify the crowd motion of individual. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields 96.20% average precision in classifying real-world highly dense crowd scenes.},

@article{Spek2008,
   abstract = {This chapter describes the results of a series of pedestrian observation studies carried out in Norwich, Rouen and Koblenz as part of the Spatial Metro project. The goal of these studies was to observe pedestrian behaviour and to investigate pedestrian movement and experience in the city centres. The cities are engaged in improving the physical conditions and the experience of their city centres by investing in landscaping and engineering of public spaces, city beautification, wayfinding and in communication and information technology.
The Spatial Metro project brings together a transnational group of partners, enabling them to co-operate with a view to improving city centres for pedestrians. The theme of spatial metro is 'Discovering the city on Foot'. The project aims to make city visits more enjoyable for pedestrians by making them easier to navigate, easier to walk around and easier to understand and appreciate.
The project has been allocated European Regional Development Funding through the INTERREG IIIB Community Initiative. A group of ten organizations participate in Spatial Metro: The lead city of Norwich (UK) and the cities of Rouen (F), Koblenz (D), Bristol (UK), Biel/Bienne (CH), as well as academics from the University of East Anglia (UK), the Delft University of Technology (NL), the University of Koblenz (D) and the Swiss Pedestrian Association.
The main role of the chair of Urban Design was to develop instruments to evaluate visitor experience and to observe the use of public space. The purpose of the observation studies was to evaluate the use of space in relation to investments, (rather than using the outcome as a design tool to pinpoint) opportunities and threads in the city; the outcome focuses on a comparison between the actual situation and real use.
For the observation of the public space, a specific method using Global Positioning System (GPS) devices capturing the movement of pedestrians was developed and put into practice. The recording of pedestrian behaviour was accompanied by a questionnaire adding background information on the participants.
This article will focus on the differences and similarities in pedestrian behaviour in three historic cities in three countries based on quantitative and qualitative research. Do people behave different in these three historic European cities? Can we distinguish different spatial patterns based on the origin and familiarity of the visitor and the purpose and duration of the visit?
After this introduction, the set-up and implementation of the fieldwork will be explained in 'Way of Working'. Here, the methods for processing the data and the criteria employed in connection with the analysis will be clarified. Following this, the results will be described and illustrations provided for each location. The chapter concludes with a synthesis comparing the findings of the different cities.},

However, this situation is rapidly changing as GPS-enabled mobile devices are increasingly becoming commonplace for pedestrian applications and as they are potential for volunteered data collection. For this reason, the development of efficient and cost-effective techniques appropriate for collecting and constructing pedestrian network databases is needed. This paper presents an algorithm for automatically identifying geometries of pedestrian path segments and constructing a pedestrian network from multiple GPS traces. The algorithm was experimented by using two sets of data sources, self-collected walking traces and OpenStreetMap (OSM) walking traces. The experiment with self-collected data was validated by comparing the constructed pedestrian network with a network baseline and calculating the quality measurements in three environment settings. The experiment with OSM traces was validated by visually inspecting maps overlaid on high-resolution images. Evaluation results show that the algorithm can automatically construct pedestrian networks. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We examine a promising new tool for promoting this linkage - the metaphor of "cities of resilience." To put this tool to best use, we indicate how metaphor fits with other conceptual tools in science. We then present the two opposing definitions of resilience from ecology, and give reasons why one is more appropriate for linking with design. Additional specific tools and insights that are emerging from, or being increasingly used in, ecology can further support the linkage with urban design. These include recognizing the role of spatial heterogeneity in both ecological and social functioning of urban areas, the integrating power of watersheds, social and ecological patch dynamics of cities, the utility of spatial mosaic models to capture function, the use of an integrated "human ecosystem" modeling framework, and the consequent perspective of metropolitan areas as integrated ecological-social systems. Three additional tools are related to the adaptability of people and human institutions. First is the recognition of a "learning loop" in metropolitan ecosystems in which people respond to and affect ecological change, the use of urban design as experiments whose ecological and social outcomes can be measured, and finally the potency of a dialog between professionals and citizens, communities, and institutions, to support both research and design. The metaphor of resilience, and its technical specifications, draw these diverse strands for linking ecology and planning together. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The present paper reviews current knowledge of older-adult problems with the main components of pedestrian activity, i.e., walking and obstacle negotiation, wayfinding, and road crossing. Compared to younger ones, old pedestrians exhibit declining walking skills, with a walking speed decrease, less stable balance, less efficient wayfinding strategies, and a greater number of unsafe road crossing behaviors. These difficulties are linked to age-related changes in sensorial, cognitive, physical , and self-perception abilities. It is now known that visual impairment, physical frailty, and attention deficits have a major negative impact on older pedestrians' safety and mobility, whereas the roles of self-evaluation and self-regulation are still poorly understood. All these elements must be taken into consideration , not only in developing effective safety interventions targeting older pedestrians, but also in designing roads and cars.

   abstract = {Design in Familiar Places incorporates the findings of Brower's fifteen years of field studies in several Balti-more urban neighborhoods to demonstrate the importance residents' perceptions and behavioral tendencies can have on design and redevelopment of urban residential environments. Brower's primary aim is to make planners and designers aware of what he has learned about how residents see their familiar world of home in fundamentally different ways from designers and what this means to successful physical planning. To do so, he weaves a skillful story of applied research, literature review and his own thinking leading to the conclusion that \&dquo;to create good housing we must create places that people care about and that satisfy their need for familiar surroundings\&dquo; (p. xv). The author, a former practitioner turned academic, has an obviously rich storehouse of experience and observations from which he draws. Most of his studies were done for the Baltimore City Department of Planning, directed by Larry Reich while Brower was Chief of Comprehensive Planning and Chief of Design Analysis. Some readers may recognize material in various sections of the book that has appeared previously in environmental literature. Brower acknowledges the influence of Appleyard and Lynch on his work, and it is likely both leaders in the process-oriented school of urban design and planning would have approved of Brower's resulting volume, especially as an example of research informing practice. The book is organized into two parts. Brower begins by laying the groundwork of broad ideas about behavior and perception of place; familiarity, satisfaction, and characteristics of home environments; and the theory and process of design itself. In Part 1, the first chapter is devoted to three modes of perception-responsive, operational, and inferen-tial-and how differences in point of view can and should influence design response. Brower then draws upon the work of, among others, Fried, Lynch, Winkel, Appleyard, Rapoport, and Lansing and Marans, as well as his own studies in Baltimore, to carefully review how residents define and judge their home environment. The third chapter recognizes the different priorities of residents and outsiders in evaluating the environment, with Brower noting it is possible for both to find satisfaction in the same place. Brower presents his study in which residents and designers each look at photographs of the built environment to show how designers commonly focus on physical proportions and patterns while residents (nondesigners) attend more to what they can read into the surface qualities of a place. In the fifth chapter, Brower builds on several more Baltimore studies to argue for two roles in design and planning: (1) expert, acting on behalf of others, to come up with ideas and solutions; and (2) facilitator, helping others define and resolve their own problems. In his wrap-up chapter of theory and practice, he exhorts those working on housing design in high-threat urban areas to see the place the way the residents do-\&dquo;as a cabin in the wilderness (not a cottage in the country)\&dquo; and design for an appropriate refuge. Part 2 is Brower's research cache of case studies to provide the resident's-eye view of Harlem Park, a predominantly black, low-income neighborhood in Balti-more. One of the city's earliest renewal projects, it consists of thirty-two residential blocks, twenty-nine of which had inner-block parks created during the 1960s. Brower's thirteen years of research in Harlem Park included techniques such as interviews, observations, person counts, doll-play games with children, and interventions. Chapter nine is a delightful and insightful collection of transcripts, letters, and staff notes about several experiments connected with the mid-block parks, including design, management, and involvement. He follows this with a summary chapter, \&dquo;As Residents See It;' including views on streetfronts, back spaces, parks, near-home spaces, and community responsibilities. Some readers, anxious for the bottom line of how to make good residential environments that work well and are cared for, may turn first to the final chapter. There they will find the author's design guidelines. Practitioners and policy-makers will find Brower's thirteen design guidelines easily accessible and to the point. Those who have enjoyed the case material effectively presented in the previous chapters will find no surprises. Brower has earned the right to make these summary \&dquo;should\&dquo; statements. These summary statements deal primarily with the design of street space in high-density urban neighborhoods : let the residents keep it lively and well-used; let them watch it, own it, manage it, use it as recreational as well as circulation space; and, above all, let the residents make the design decisions.},

To address these challenges, this paper introduces the use of a stereo thermal camera setup for pedestrian counting. We investigate the reconstruction of 3D points in a pedestrian street with two thermal cameras and propose an algorithm for pedestrian counting based on clustering and tracking of the 3D point clouds. The method is tested on two five-minute video sequences captured at a public event with a moderate density of pedestrians and heavy occlusions. The counting performance is compared to the manually annotated ground truth and shows success rates of 95.4% and 99.1% for the two sequences.},

   abstract = {The ability to detect and distinguish interactions in the workplace can shed light over productivity, team work and on employees' use of space. Questionnaires and direct observations have often been used as mechanisms to identify office based interactions, however, these are either very time consuming, yield coarse grained information or do not scale to large numbers of people. Technology has been recently employed to cut costs and improve output, however precise interaction dynamics gathering often requires individuals to wear custom hardware. In this paper, we present an extensive evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a technology to monitor people proximity in the workplace. We examine the key parameters that affect the accuracy of the detected contacts and their impact on power consumption. We study how this system can be implemented on popular wearable devices (i.e., Android Wear and Tizen) and the resulting limitations. Through a real world deployment in a commercial organisation with 25 participants we evaluate the performances of a BLE-based proximity detection technique. Our results show the suitability of BLE for workplace interaction detection and give guidance to vendors and Operating System (OS) developers on the impact of the restrictions regarding the use of BLE on commodity wearables.},

   abstract = {Automatic face recognition is an area with immense practical potential which includes a wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications. Hence it is unsurprising that it continues to be one of the most active research areas of computer vision. Even after over three decades of intense research, the state-of-the-art in face recognition continues to improve, benefitting from advances in a range of different research fields such as image processing, pattern recognition, computer graphics, and physiology. Systems based on visible spectrum images, the most researched face recognition modality, have reached a significant level of maturity with some practical success. However, they continue to face challenges in the presence of illumination, pose and expression changes, as well as facial disguises, all of which can significantly decrease recognition accuracy. Amongst various approaches which have been proposed in an attempt to overcome these limitations, the use of infrared (IR) imaging has emerged as a particularly promising research direction. This paper presents a comprehensive and timely review of the literature on this subject. Our key contributions are (i) a summary of the inherent properties of infrared imaging which makes this modality promising in the context of face recognition; (ii) a systematic review of the most influential approaches, with a focus on emerging common trends as well as key differences between alternative methodologies; (iii) a description of the main databases of infrared facial images available to the researcher; and lastly (iv) a discussion of the most promising avenues for future research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Currently, pedestrian simulation models are used to predict where, when and why hazardous high density crowd movements arise. However, it is questionable whether models developed for low density situations can be used to simulate high density crowd movements. The objective of this paper is to assess the existent pedestrian simulation models with respect to known crowd phenomena in order to ascertain whether these models can indeed be used for the simulation of high density crowds and to indicate any gaps in the field of pedestrian simulation modeling research.This paper provides a broad, but not exhaustive overview of the crowd motion simulation models of the last decades. It is argued that any model used for crowd simulation should be able to simulate most of the phenomena indicated in this paper. In the paper cellular automata, social force models, velocity-based models, continuum models, hybrid models, behavioral models and network models are discussed. The comparison shows that the models can roughly be divided into slow but highly precise microscopic modeling attempts and very fast but behaviorally questionable macroscopic modeling attempts. Both sets of models have their use, which is highly dependent on the application the model has originally been developed for. Yet, for practical applications, that need both precision and speed, the current pedestrian simulation models are inadequate.},

From preventing stampede in high concentration crowds to estimating crowd density and to surveilling crowd movements, crowd monitoring and analysis have long been employed in the past by authorities and regulatory bodies to tackle challenges posed by large crowds. Conventional methods of crowd analysis using static cameras are limited due to their low coverage area and non-flexible perspectives and features. Unmanned aerial vehicles have tremendously increased the quality of images obtained for crowd analysis reasons, relieving the relevant authorities of the venues’ inadequacies and of concerns of inaccessible locations and situation. This paper reviews existing literature sources regarding the use of aerial vehicles for crowd monitoring and analysis purposes. Vehicle specifications, onboard sensors, power management, and an analysis algorithm are critically reviewed and discussed. In addition, ethical and privacy issues surrounding the use of this technology are presented.},

A gait phase information retrieval algorithm was developed to analyze the duration of the phases in a gait cycle (i.e., stance, push-off, swing, and heel-strike phases). Based on the gait phase information, a decision tree based on the relations between gait phases was constructed for classifying three different walking patterns (level walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs). Gait phase information was also used for developing a walking distance estimation algorithm. The walking distance estimation algorithm consists of the processes of step count and step length estimation. The proposed walking pattern classification and walking distance estimation algorithm have been validated by a series of experiments. The accuracy of the proposed walking pattern classification was 98.87, 95.45, and 95.00 for level walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs, respectively.

   abstract = {Introduction Pedestrian falls (PFs) – falls in public spaces without collisions with other road users – are a significant cause of serious transport-related injuries, amounting to three-quarters of all pedestrians admitted to hospital. Methods This scoping review examined peer-reviewed research on PFs published between 1995 and 2015. Electronic databases (Scopus, SafetyLit, and PubMed) were used to find studies identifying PFs or outdoor falls (the latter also including falls in gardens). Results We identified only 28 studies reporting relevant information on PFs (i.e., 15 prospective, 10 retrospective, and 3 intervention studies). The results show that more walking is related to a lower risk of PFs. Older people, especially older women, have a higher risk of (injurious) PFs. Outdoor fall victims have equally good or better health characteristics and scores on balance tests compared to those who have not experienced such falls. Road factors such as uneven surfaces, busy junctions, stairs, and slippery surfaces seem to play an important role in PFs, but much of the research on these factors is of a qualitative nature. Conclusions PF victims are generally in good health (apart from normal age-related problems) but at risk due to road factors. Practical applications We recommend to adopt a human factors approach. The road system should be adapted to human capabilities and limitations including those of pedestrians. Measures such as preventing uneven surfaces and good winter maintenance seem to be effective. However, we advise more quantitative research on road factors to inform design guidelines and standards for public space authorities given the qualitative nature of current research on road factors.},

   abstract = {Background: Neighborhood built environment may profoundly influence children's physical activity (PA) and body weight. This study systematically reviewed scientific evidence regarding the impact of built environment on PA and obesity among children and adolescents in China. Methods: A keyword and reference search was conducted in Active Living Research, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science. Studies that met all of the following criteria were included in the review: (1) study designs—experimental studies, observational studies, and qualitative studies; (2) study subjects—Chinese children and/or adolescents aged ≤17 years; (3) exposures—neighborhood built environment; (4) outcomes—PA and/or body weight status; (5) article type—peer-reviewed publications; (6) time window of search—from the inception of an electronicbibliographic database to May 31, 2018; (7) country—China; and (8) language—articles written in English. Results: A total of 20 studies, including 16 cross-sectional studies, 3 longitudinal studies, and 1 descriptive study, met the predetermined selection criteria and were included in the review. A total of 13 studies adopted subjective built environment measures reported by parents and/or children,2 adopted objective measures (e.g., geographical information system, field observations), and 5 adopted both objective and subjective measures. PA behaviors included PA, physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, active/passive commuting from/to school, and park visits. Among the 16 studies that provided some quantitative estimates of the influence of built environment on PA and body weight status, all reported a statistically significant relationship in the expected direction. Availability and accessibility in proximity to greenspaces, parks, recreational facilities, and sidewalks were found to be associated with increased PA levels, reduced sedentary behaviors, and/or active commuting among Chinese childrenand adolescents. In contrast, the absence of bike lanes and living in higher density residential areas were associated with increased likelihood of childhood overweight and obesity. Conclusion: Neighborhood built environment plays an important role in Chinese children's PA engagement and weight outcomes. Building new exercise facilities and enhancing the accessibility of existing facilities hold the potential to enhance PA engagement among Chinese children and adolescents. In addition, urban designs that incorporate sidewalks, bike lanes, walking paths, less motorized traffic, and lower residential density are likely to promote PA and prevent childhood obesity in China.},

Method: Cross-sectional analyses were performed in spring 2012 on data collected from December 2008 until May 2010 for 284 middle school youth from a rural county and an adjacent urbanized area. Multivariable linear models estimated associations between BMI/MVPA and perceived environmental barriers/supports for physical activity and objectively measured neighborhood spatial variables. Results: Mean MVPA was significantly lower for rural youth (15.9. min/day) compared to urban youth (19.2. min/day). No differences were observed between rural and urban youth for BMI or BMI percentile. Significant differences in both perceived and objective correlates for MVPA and BMI percentile were found in multivariable models between rural and urban youth. Conclusion: Differences observed for correlates of MVPA and BMI across the settings suggest that rurality should be considered when identifying targets for intervention to promote MVPA and prevent adiposity in youth. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We conducted a systematic review using the following data sources: Medline, Embase, Psychinfo, GreenFILE, SportDISCUS, The Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Arts and Humanities Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index -Science and BIOSIS from inception to June 2010. Internet searches of relevant Web sites, hand searches of relevant journals, and the reference lists of included papers and other review papers identified in the search were also searched for relevant information. Controlled trials (randomized and nonrandomized) were included. To be eligible trials had to compare the effects of outdoor exercise initiatives with those conducted indoors and report on at least one physical or mental wellbeing outcome in adults or children. Screening of articles for inclusion, data extraction, and quality appraisal were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third if necessary. Due to the heterogeneity of identified studies a narrative synthesis was performed. Eleven trials (833 adults) were included. Most participants (6 trials; 523 adults) were young students. Study entry criteria and methods were sparsely reported. All interventions consisted of a single episode of walking or running indoors with the same activity at a similar level conducted outdoors on a separate occasion. A total of 13 different outcome measures were used to evaluate the effects of exercise on mental wellbeing, and 4 outcome measures were used to assess attitude to exercise. Most trials (n = 9) showed some improvement in mental wellbeing on one or other of the outcome measures. Compared with exercising indoors, exercising in natural environments was associated with greater feelings of revitalization and positive engagement, decreases in tension, confusion, anger, and depression, and increased energy. However, the results suggested that feelings of calmness may be decreased following outdoor exercise. Participants reported greater enjoyment and satisfaction with outdoor activity and declared a greater intent to repeat the activity at a later date. None of the identified studies measured the effects of physical activity on physical wellbeing or the effect of natural environments on exercise adherence. The hypothesis that there are added beneficial effects to be gained from performing physical activity outdoors in natural environments is very appealing and has generated considerable interest. This review has shown some promising effects on self-reported mental wellbeing immediately following exercise in nature which are not seen following the same exercise indoors. However, the interpretation and extrapolation of these findings is hampered by the poor methodological quality of the available evidence and the heterogeneity of outcome measures employed. The review demonstrates the paucity of high quality evidence on which to base recommendations and reveals an undoubted need for further research in this area. Large, well designed, longer term trials in populations who might benefit most from the potential advantages of outdoor exercise are needed to fully elucidate the effects on mental and physical wellbeing. The influence of these effects on the sustainability of physical activity initiatives also awaits investigation. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Methods: A multi-level analysis of data from 4,317 older adults (mean age = 74.5; 73% black) from a geographically-defined urban community. Participants completed structured interviews including 14 questions on neighborhood conditions and self-reported walking. The neighborhood questions were summarized into individual-level measures of perceived neighborhood social cohesion and disorder. These measures were aggregated by neighborhood to construct neighborhood-level measures of social cohesion and disorder. Results: Neighborhood-level disorder, but not social cohesion, was significantly associated with walking, independent individual-level neighborhood perceptions and other correlates of walking. Further adjustment for race weakened this association to a marginally significant level. Discussion: Neighborhood conditions may shape walking behavior in older adults, especially conditions that reflect physical neglect or social threat. Promotion of walking behavior in older adults may require improvement of the safety and upkeep of the neighborhood environment. © 2009 Sage Publications.},

This paper examines the proposition that more walkable neighbourhoods encourage local social interaction, a sense of community, informal social control and social cohesion; and that the relationship is explained by walking for transport or for recreation. Multilevel analyses of data from an Australian sample showed a modest association between the walkability of a neighbourhood and sense of community only. Walking for transport, but not recreation, mediated this relationship although the effect was small. These results support contentions that 'walkability' is more complex than usually defined and that factors influencing neighbourhood sociability extend beyond issues of urban form.},

   abstract = {Many argue that monitoring conducted exclusively by scientists is insufficient to address ongoing environmental challenges. One solution entails the use of mobile digital devices in participatory monitoring (PM) programs. But how digital data entry affects programs with varying levels of stakeholder participation, from nonscientists collecting field data to nonscientists administering every step of a monitoring program, remains unclear. We reviewed the successes, in terms of management interventions and sustainability, of 107 monitoring programs described in the literature (hereafter programs) and compared these with case studies from our PM experiences in Australia, Canada, Ethiopia, Ghana, Greenland, and Vietnam (hereafter cases). Our literature review showed that participatory programs were less likely to use digital devices, and 2 of our 3 more participatory cases were also slow to adopt digital data entry. Programs that were participatory and used digital devices were more likely to report management actions, which was consistent with cases in Ethiopia, Greenland, and Australia. Programs engaging volunteers were more frequently reported as ongoing, but those involving digital data entry were less often sustained when data collectors were volunteers. For the Vietnamese and Canadian cases, sustainability was undermined by a mismatch in stakeholder objectives. In the Ghanaian case, complex field protocols diminished monitoring sustainability. Innovative technologies attract interest, but the foundation of effective participatory adaptive monitoring depends more on collaboratively defined questions, objectives, conceptual models, and monitoring approaches. When this foundation is built through effective partnerships, digital data entry can enable the collection of more data of higher quality. Without this foundation, or when implemented ineffectively or unnecessarily, digital data entry can be an additional expense that distracts from core monitoring objectives and undermines project sustainability. The appropriate role of digital data entry in PM likely depends more on the context in which it is used and less on the technology itself.},

   abstract = {Twenty-six percent of worldwide road fatalities are pedestrians, and the state of art suggests that not following the traffic signals by pedestrians is one of the most common causes of accidents. Therefore, this research estimates on one hand, through an observational study, four models to establish the significant variables in the pedestrians' obedience of traffic signals in a signalized intersection. On the other hand, it was proven through surveys, the level of road safety knowledge and how the socioeconomic factors influence the probability that pedestrians obey traffic signals and do not engage in risky behaviors. For the observational study, the variables analyzed are the pedestrian characteristics, obedience to signs, vehicle interaction, the time of day, and the infrastructure. The existence of vehicular flow, that the pedestrian crossing is obstructed and that the pedestrian waits in a group, are the variables with the greatest influence on the probability that the pedestrian does not assume risky behaviors when crossing. The factors that influence the probability of obeying the pedestrian traffic light are the existence of vehicular flow, the user running, and the time of the day; factors for the compliance of the pedestrian crossing are that the crossing is obstructed, the number of lanes, and the presence of vehicular flow; while for the probability of running, factors for compliance are obedience to the traffic light, that the user crosses in the group, and the location of the pedestrian crossing. This study is a first approach to estimate the variables that influence the observance of traffic signals and risk behaviors.},

   abstract = {One of the major challenges that autonomous cars are facing today is driving in urban environments. To make it a reality, autonomous vehicles require the ability to communicate with other road users and understand their intentions. Such interactions are essential between vehicles and pedestrians, the most vulnerable road users. Understanding pedestrian behavior, however, is not intuitive and depends on various factors, such as demographics of the pedestrians, traffic dynamics, environmental conditions, and so on. In this paper, we identify these factors by surveying pedestrian behavior studies, both the classical works on pedestrian-driver interaction and the modern ones that involve autonomous vehicles. To this end, we will discuss various methods of studying pedestrian behavior and analyze how the factors identified in the literature are interrelated. We will also review the practical applications aimed at solving the interaction problem, including design approaches for autonomous vehicles that communicate with pedestrians and visual perception and reasoning algorithms tailored to understanding pedestrian intention. Based on our findings, we will discuss the open problems and propose future research directions.},

As nonintrusive autonomous sensing and context recognition are desirable characteristics of a personal sensing system; efforts have been made to develop opportunistic sensing techniques on mobile phones. The resulting combination of these approaches has ushered in a new realm of applications, namely opportunistic user context recognition with mobile phones. This article surveys the existing research and approaches towards realization of such systems. In doing so, the typical architecture of a mobile-centric user context recognition system as a sequential process of sensing, preprocessing, and context recognition phases is introduced. The main techniques used for the realization of the respective processes during these phases are described, and their strengths and limitations are highlighted. In addition, lessons learned from previous approaches are presented as motivation for future research. Finally, several open challenges are discussed as possible ways to extend the capabilities of current systems and improve their real-world experience. © 2013 ACM.},

A novel secure arrangement method is proposed in this paper, which is based on matrix eigenvalue calculation. Compared with the current secure arrangement methods, the proposed method is more robust and efficient, which drives the proposed scheme to be more suitable for repeated aggregation. Then we use an example to illustrate how to use the proposed arrangement method to construct a privacy data collection protocol.

   abstract = {"Smart cities" are a buzzword of the moment. Although legal interest is growing, most academic responses at least in the EU, are still from the technological, urban studies, environmental and sociological rather than legal, sectors  and  have primarily laid emphasis on the social, urban, policing and environmental benefits of smart cities, rather than their challenges, in often a rather uncritical fashion. However a growing backlash from the privacy and surveillance sectors warns of the potential threat to personal privacy posed by smart cities. A key issue is the lack of opportunity in an ambient or smart city environment for the giving of meaningful consent to processing of personal data; other crucial issues include the degree to which smart cities collect private data from inevitable public interactions, the "privatisation" of  ownership of both infrastructure and data,  the repurposing of "big data" drawn from IoT in smart cities and the storage of that data in the Cloud. This paper, drawing on author engagement with smart city development in Glasgow as well as the results of an international conference in the area curated by the author, argues that smart cities combine the three greatest current threats to personal privacy, with which regulation has so far failed to deal effectively; the Internet of Things (IoT)  or "ubiquitous computing";  "Big Data"; and the Cloud. It seeks solutions both from legal institutions such as data protection law and from "code", proposing in particular from the ethos of Privacy by Design, a new "social impact assessment" and new human:computer interactions to promote user autonomy in ambient environments. },

These critiques are important, and to some extent, have set scholarly inquiry on a new, exciting and broader, trajectory than that offered by privacy scholars. On closer examination, however, these critiques are often based on some faulty assumptions about the contemporary framing of the privacy issue, and about the governance of the issue. Privacy, as a concept, regime, a set of policy instruments, and as a way to frame civil society activism, shows an extraordinary resilience. Surveillance scholars must learn to live with it.},

Data and information from different case studies carried out globally assisted in the inductive approach. Content analysis identified smart city indicators and related criteria in the case study examples. The study concluded that smart people, smart living, and smart governance methods that have come into practice at a later stage are as important as smart mobility, smart environments, and smart economy measures that were implemented early on, and cities are opening up to new, transparent participatory governance approaches where citizens play a key role.

Firstly, an line-of-sight (LOS) Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model is established by RSSI value and actual distance between the Bluetooth-Low-Energy beacon and the terminal equipment. Secondly, based on the LOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model and the threshold-corrected RSSI peak, an NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model is established. Thirdly, the NLOS RSSI value is processed by the NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model to obtain the optimal ranging value. Finally, high precision positioning coordinates can be obtained by using NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy positioning algorithm and optimal Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging. In this paper, two experiments are carried out, and the experimental results show that: in the range of 7 m, the average ranging accuracy of the improved NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging method is 0.37 m, which is improved 49.19% when compared to the traditional method’s results. The average positioning accuracy is 0.4 m using the positioning algorithm proposed in this paper. Therefore, in NLOS environment, the proposed ranging method and positioning algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging and positioning.},

To design energy-efficient devices, the protocol provides a number of parameters that need to be optimized within an energy, latency, and throughput design space. Therefore, an energy model that can predict the energy consumption of a BLE-based wireless device for different parameter value settings is needed. As BLE differs from the well-known Bluetooth Basic Rate (BR) significantly, models for Bluetooth BR cannot be easily applied to the BLE protocol. In past years, there have been a couple of proposals on energy models for BLE. However, none of them can model all the operating modes of the protocol. This article presents an energy model of the BLE protocol, which allows the computation of a device's power consumption in all possible operating modes. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed model is not only one of the most accurate ones known so far (be-cause it accounts for all protocol parameters), but it is also the only one that models all the operating modes of BLE. Based on this model, guidelines for system designers are presented that help choose the right parameters for optimizing the energy consumption. The model is publicly available as a software library for download.},

   abstract = {Previous indoor positioning research has mainly been focused on using Wi-Fi and RFID. In recent years, researchers began to study using Bluetooth 4.0 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor positioning purposes. In general, positioning techniques based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI), such as signal propagation and fingerprint, are commonly used in wireless/mobile networks. These techniques have certain limitations and tradeoff in terms of accuracy, ease of implementation and practical application/deployment. For example, both methods require a training process before deployment. In this paper, we present a decentralized BLE-based positioning protocol that does not require training before deployment. The training process can automatically be done on the fly by the anchor nodes. While the anchor nodes are broadcasting, they also scan for signals emitted by other anchors. This collaborative communication process exchanges location information and signal strength measurements between each anchor. This process builds a signal-to-distance reference list for the target node to estimate physical distance in a more accurate way. Experimentation in a real indoor environment shows that the proposed collaborative positioning method can achieve an error of 1.5 meters on average. This is generally applicable for most indoor positioning applications for locating people. Furthermore, its implementation is simple and practical, because it does not require training before positioning estimation and is adaptive to environmental changes.},

There are applications that require more than one BLE node to simultaneously transmit data. The BLE protocol utilizes a specific communication method termed the advertising mode to perform unidirectional broadcasts of data from the advertising devices. However, with an increased number of BLE devices advertising simultaneously, there will be inevitable packet collisions from the advertising devices. This results in a waste of energy, specifically in low-power applications where lower consumption is desirable to minimize the need for battery replacements. This paper examines a packet collision model for the BLE advertising mode with the results validated using experimental data. Our analysis shows that when the throughput of the BLE network starts to fall due to an increase in the number of packet collisions, the energy consumption of the BLE nodes increases exponentially with respect to the number of nodes.},

While RSS measurements are recognized to suffer from errors due to the random nature of the fading channel, proximity measurements, ie., knowing only whether or not two devices are in communication range, are often discussed without considering that they are affected by the same fading channel. Proximity measurements are actually just a binary quantization of RSS measurements. We use the Cramér-Rao bound (ORB) to compare the minimal attainable variances of unbiased sensor location estimators for the cases of RSS and proximity measurements. For completeness, we also present the CRB for sensor localization with systems using K-level quantized RSS (QRSS) measurements, of which proximity measurements are the special case: K = 2. Examples are presented for the case of one unknown-location sensor, and for the case of a 5 by 5 grid of sensors. These examples show that lower bounds for standard deviation in proximity-based systems are, as a rule of thumb, about 50% higher than the bounds for RSS-based systems. Furthermore, results are presented which show how many bits of quantization are necessary for a QRSS-based system to nearly achieve the bounds of an unquantized RSS system.},

This combination has the potential to enable a wide range of new applications. When individuals wear a radio frequency tag, they may be both identified and localized. In this way, the technology may interact with individuals in a personalized way. In this paper, two radio frequency identification technologies, UHF Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), are combined with a stereo-based people detection system to recognize individuals in groups in complex outdoor scenarios in medium sized areas up to 20 m. The proposed approach is validated in crosswalks with pedestrians wearing portable RFID passive tags and active BLE beacons.},

Measurements have been conducted both in indoors and outdoors scenarios. Performance of BLE 5 is compared to a previous release of BLE 4 which is currently the most used technology in commercial wireless healthcare and medical devices. This new improved BLE version may continue fostering the success of BLE use in those application scenarios as well as enable novel Internet of Things solutions. The main goal of this work was to evaluate, experimentally, the communications range and throughput performance of BLE 5 coded version which claims to provide fourfold improvement to the previous version of BLE. Measurement results obtained using the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 chipset are reported for indoor and outdoor cases relevant to healthcare and medical scenarios. Results show the practical communications range and throughput of the BLE 5 coded version, giving insight about the possible application space improvements for BLE technology. Specifically, our measurements showed that BLE 5 coded mode provides approximately 9 dB radio link budget gain compared to BLE 4, which leads to more than twofold communications range improvement in line-of-sight outdoor scenario and 10–20% improvement in non-line-of-sight indoor scenario.},

Five factors including received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-distance relationship, rainfall effects on the signals, motion effects, non-line of sight effects and signal transmission rates were selected for evaluation. These factors were selected considering the requirements of vehicle–pedestrian collision warning systems and compared with each other based on experimental outcomes. The results of the experiments indicated the overall superiority of BLE mode over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modes to be utilized in these systems. Application of this mode may provide the possibility of fast collision warnings thanks to low signal transmission intervals and high probability of simultaneous signal detections by multiple signals scanners. Moreover, the capability of this mode to accurately estimate distance and position is higher than Wi-Fi mode and not significantly different from Bluetooth mode.},

Electromagnetic wave propagation models show that the attenuation by rain begins to have a significant impact for frequencies above 10 GHz. However, in some systems operating at 2.4 GHz there is packet loss when it is raining. So, a 2.4 GHz outdoor wireless sensor network was set up to study the influence of meteorological parameters in the received signal. Our results show a significant impact on link quality when it is raining. We also observed that temperature affects the link’s quality, exhibiting a daily cycle, improving communications when the temperature is cooler.},

Through densification and compact building, the approach aims to counteract negative effects of urban sprawl in terms of ineffective land-use and related environmental problems. In spite of its benefits various problems and challenges are associated with implementing the compact city approach. This review looks at the effects of urban densification and compact city development on urban green space and its planning. It identifies problems, challenges and strategies of urban green space planning during densification processes. Findings confirm that urban densification processes, including consolidation and infill development, can pose a threat to urban green space. However, the literature on the compact city approach often lacks specific suggestions for urban green space conservation and planning. Provision of urban green space in compact city environments and during densification processes is described as a major challenge. Loss of private urban green space rarely seems offset by provision of more public green space. Several ways are identified to deal with these challenges, while also highlighting research gaps, e.g., as to how loss of green space quantity can be offset by increased green space quality.},

As a result, smart cities emerged mainly as a result of highly innovative ICT industries and markets, and additionally, they have started to use novel solutions taking advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and cloud computing technologies to establish a profound connection between each component and layer of a city. Several key technologies congregate to build a working smart city considering human requirements. Even though the smart city concept is an advanced solution for today's cities, recently, more living spaces should be discovered, and the concept of a smart city could be moved to these alternative living spaces, namely floating cities. The concept of a floating city emerged as a novel solution due to rising sea levels and land scarcity in order to provide alternative living spaces for humanity. In this article, our main research question is to raise awareness on the current state of smart city concepts across the world by understanding the key future trends, including floating cities, by motivating researchers and scientists through new IoT technologies and applications. Therefore, we present a survey of smart city initiatives and analyze their key concepts and different data management techniques. We performed a detailed literature survey and review by applying a complex literature matrix including terms, like smart people, smart economy, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart living. We also discuss multiple perspectives of smart floating cities in detail. With the proposed approach, recent advances and practical future opportunities for smart cities can be revealed.},

   abstract = {Cities play a prominent role in our economic development as more than 80 % of the gross world product (GWP) comes from cities. Only 600 urban areas with just 20 % of the world population generate 60 % of the GWP. Rapid urbanization, climate change, inadequate maintenance of water and wastewater infrastructures and poor solid waste management may lead to flooding, water scarcity, water pollution, adverse health effects and rehabilitation costs that may overwhelm the resilience of cities. These megatrends pose urgent challenges in cities as the cost of inaction is high. We present an overview about population growth, urbanization, water, waste, climate change, water governance and transitions. Against this background, we discuss the categorization of cities based on our baseline assessments, i.e. our City Blueprint research on 45 municipalities and regions predominantly in Europe. With this bias towards Europe in mind, the challenges can be discussed globally by clustering cities into distinct categories of sustainability and by providing additional data and information from global regions. We distinguish five categories of sustainability: (1) cities lacking basic water services, (2) wasteful cities, (3) water-efficient cities, (4) resource-efficient and adaptive cities and (5) water-wise cities. Many cities in Western Europe belong to categories 3 and 4. Some cities in Eastern Europe and the few cities we have assessed in Latin America, Asia and Africa can be categorized as cities lacking basic water services. Lack of water infrastructures or obsolete infrastructures, solid waste management and climate adaptation are priorities. It is concluded that cities require a long-term framing of their sectoral challenges into a proactive and coherent Urban Agenda to maximize the co-benefits of adaptation and to minimize the cost. Furthermore, regional platforms of cities are needed to enhance city-to-city learning and to improve governance capacities necessary to accelerate effective and efficient transitions towards water-wise cities. These learning alliances are needed as the time window to solve the global water governance crisis is narrow and rapidly closing. The water sector can play an important role but needs to reframe and refocus radically.},

Understanding how the urban economy and its decision making function as well as how they are connected to a larger world (regional, national, global) is fundamental to create governance mechanisms and the institutions to move the world towards a green economy. This paper analyzes the city through its key economic processes of the transformation of space; circulation (transport); consumption and production and social, knowledge and ecosystem services. Transforming urban processes will only be achieved with better urban governance. As gover-nance is embedded in institutions, it is the foundation for building the legitimate political and social mechanisms to green socio-ecological and economic systems. Yet the question of whether or not current governance systems in these processes are steering cities towards a greener economy, or if they are, how are they affecting people and ecosystems is yet to be addressed. Thus, we propose a set of governance indicators to assess the greening of urban processes that go beyond the decision-making procedures and include the capacity to implement change, the results of greening the economy and final outcomes on the ground. We also look at the obstacles, achievements and lessons in the greening of the direct and indirect economic processes in cities.},

It recognizes four salient research epistemologies, each focusing on a distinct combination of drivers of change: (A) transforming urban metabolisms and political ecologies; (B) configuring urban innovation systems for green economies; (C) building adaptive urban communities and ecosystems; and (D) empowering urban grassroots niches and social innovation. The findings suggest that future research directed at cities and systemic change towards sustainability should (1) explore interrelations between the above epistemologies, using relational geography and governance theory as boundary areas; (2) conceive of cities as places shaped by and shaping interactions between multiple socio-technical and social-ecological systems; (3) focus on agency across systems and drivers of change, and develop corresponding approaches for intervention and experimentation; and (4) rebalance the empirical basis and methods employed, strengthening transdisciplinarity in particular.},

The report represents a rich resource for reliable and up-to-date information about individual renewable energy sources and their use. The analysis also covers a review of energy policies. Renewable energy policies still strongly concentrate on the power sector, while transport and heating and cooling are given less attention. Most investment in renewable energy today happens in developing and emerging countries, which is a major change to the situation some years ago. The 2019 edition of the GSR report includes a feature on renewable energy in cities, which highlights the importance of prioritising the urban context in order to achieve more sustainable schemes of energy supply and consumption. More than half of the global population today lives in cities, but around two-thirds of energy consumption happens in an urban environment. The GSR 2019 identifies that cities already are among the most active players in the adoption of renewable energies. One interesting finding is that in more than 100 cities worldwide at least 70% of the electricity already comes from renewables. This includes cities in both developed and developing countries.},

The purpose of this article is therefore to analyse how cities and municipalities can support and facilitate the circular economy through multiple modes of governance, e.g. through the use of own assets to support the circular economy; the use of the ownership of utilities and waste companies to support the circular economy; the use of rule enforcement and/or economic regulation or through facilitating, coordinating, collaborating and encouraging. The analysis in the article is based on two in-depth case studies of projects seeking circular economies, in which Danish municipalities collaborated with local stakeholders to close the material loop for demolition materials and textile waste. Overall, this study is based on an action research approach that emphasises the benefits of co-innovation processes carried out between multiple stakeholders. The analysis of the case studies concluded that municipalities can function as an important change agent to support and facilitate a transformation towards a circular economy.},

   abstract = {<p>To test simulation models of pedestrian flows, we have performed experiments for corridors, bottleneck areas, and intersections. Our evaluations of video recordings show that the geometric boundary conditions are not only relevant for the capacity of the elements of pedestrian facilities, they also influence the time gap distribution of pedestrians, indicating the existence of self-organization phenomena. After calibration of suitable models, these findings can be used to improve design elements of pedestrian facilities and egress routes. It turns out that “obstacles” can stabilize flow patterns and make them more fluid. Moreover, intersecting flows can be optimized, utilizing the phenomenon of “stripe formation.” We also suggest increasing diameters of egress routes in stadia, theaters, and lecture halls to avoid long waiting times for people in the back, and shock waves due to impatience in cases of emergency evacuation. Moreover, zigzag-shaped geometries and columns can reduce the pressure in panicking crowds. The proposed design solutions are expected to increase the efficiency and safety of train stations, airport terminals, stadia, theaters, public buildings, and mass events in the future. As application examples we mention the evacuation of passenger ships and the simulation of pilgrim streams on the Jamarat bridge. Adaptive escape guidance systems, optimal way systems, and simulations of urban pedestrian flows are addressed as well.</p>},

   abstract = {Urban sprawl and increasing population density in urban centers create the challenge to finding ways of sustainable transportation solutions that preserve the convenience of residents while reducing emissions. Therefore, walkability is a core urban design element because of being advantageous onto three fronts: health, livability, and sustainability. Adopting walkability as urban solution relieves conceptual and practical tensions between the individualistic interests manifested in the desire to own and use private cars, and the need to reduce transportation-based consumption. This review advocates that long-term health benefits from walking and physical activity are the premier incentive to repurpose our cities to be more sustainable and more walking friendly, and spark behavioral change into reducing car dependency for all daily transportations. The review inspects physical elements of the built environment that make the walking trip feasible and desirable, such as connectivity, accessibility, and closeness of destination points, presence of greenness and parks, commercial retail, and proximity to transit hubs and stations. Hence, this review explores a few popular walkability evaluation indices and frameworks that employ subjective, objective, and/or distinctive methods within variant environmental, cultural, and national context. There is no unified universal standardized walkability theory despite the need for rigorous evaluation tools for policy makers and developers. Furthermore, there is a lack of emphasis on air quality and thermal stress while approaching walkability, despite being important elements in the walking experience. Research opportunities in the field of walkability can leverage location tracking from smart devices and identify the interaction patterns of pedestrians with other transportation modes, especially for those with fundamental movement challenges such as wheelchair users.},

   abstract = {Objective Over 6400 American pedestrians die annually, a figure that is currently increasing. One hypothesised reason for the increasing trend is the role of mobile technology in distracting both pedestrians and drivers. Scientists and policy-makers have attended somewhat to distracted driving, but attention to distracted pedestrian behaviour has lagged. We will evaluate Bluetooth beacon technology as a means to alert and warn pedestrians when they approach intersections, reminding them to attend to the traffic environment and cross streets safely.

Methods Bluetooth beacons are small devices that broadcast information unidirectionally within a closed proximal network. We will place beacons at an intersection frequently trafficked by urban college students. From there, the beacons will transmit to an app installed on users’ smartphones, signalling users to attend to their environment and cross the street safely. A cross-over trial will evaluate the app with 411 adults who frequently cross the target intersection on an urban university campus. We will monitor those participants’ behaviour over three distinct time periods: (1) 3 weeks without the app being activated, (2) 3 weeks with the app activated and (3) 4 weeks without the app activated to assess retention of behaviour. Throughout the 10-week period, we will gather information to evaluate whether the intervention changes distracted pedestrian behaviour using a logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of key behavioural outcome measures and adjusting for any residual confounding. We also will test for changes in perceived risk. The trial will follow CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement guidelines, as modified for cross-over design studies.

Conclusion If this program proves successful, it offers exciting implications for future testing and ultimately for broad distribution to reduce distracted pedestrian behavior. We discuss issues of feasibility, acceptability and scalability.},

It can provide information to pedestrians about the location and directions of a crosswalk, and the traffic signal status. In general, a pedestrian who is visually impaired uses a 358.5MHz wireless remote controller to activate the APS and crosses at the crosswalk with the help of the APS. The existing APS can only receive an activation message from the remote controller. Therefore, the APS has an issue, especially at intersections, that all APSs within the communication range of the remote controller are activated simultaneously. It makes to confuse the visual impaired pedestrians. In this paper, we propose a BLE-enabled APS that can enable two-way communication via Bluetooth with a smartphone.

Accidents with pedestrians are very often the result of various factors related to the infrastructure and behaviour of pedestrians and drivers. The objective of the work was to assess driver and pedestrian behaviour in pedestrian crossing areas. The research also served as a pilot study for similar work to be conducted across Poland, and constituted the basis for monitoring the behaviour of road users in the area of pedestrian crossings. Parameters which must be analysed were identified on the basis of field studies. Principles of selecting test sites were adopted, and measurement methods for pedestrian crossing areas are presented. The influence of the location of the selected test cross-section infrastructure parameters on the behaviour of road users in pedestrian crossing areas is demonstrated. The results of the study will be used as a basis for new solutions involving pedestrian crossing infrastructure designed to improve pedestrian safety. The results were also used in formulating new regulations for the design and maintenance of pedestrian crossings and recommendations for road safety auditors.</p>},

One such sensing technology includes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which could be used to study pedestrian traffic. This can subsequently be used to understand utilisation of spaces and to ameliorate mobility and transportation. Such studies can contribute to urban (re-)development plans to sustainably smarten the built environment, but this is only possible by having a clear understanding of the nature of BLE signal propagation and correlating its Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values to environmental topology and pedestrian movements. Additionally, in comparison to other pedestrian behaviour monitoring technologies, BLE limits pedestrians identification and hence, can be aligned to preserve their privacy. In this paper, we highlight the effect that body occlusion has on BLE RSSI values. The objective is to identify indicators in the pattern of RSSI values that identifies the way BLE devices are carried by pedestrians moving in the environment. This study will allow planners who study pedestrian traffic to form a better understanding of BLE signal propagation and signal interaction in outdoor environments. The knowledge acquired through this study will feed in to the development of an outdoor pedestrian monitoring system that is capable of identifying pedestrian behavioural patterns while preserving their privacy.},

   abstract = {Objects such as vehicles are considered one of challenging obstruction on the road and very little attention has been made to address its significance on the wireless signal. As such, this paper validates the impact of vehicle obstruction on signal propagation using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based on the wireless channel measurements of realistic environmental obstruction at 2.4 GHz frequency band. Low mobility IEEE 802.15.4 XBee S2C compliant device which is designed to collect received signal power was used and these devices were deployed at area congested with cars. The channel measurements were conducted on LOS car parking area with two scenarios; single-sided and double-sided vehicle obstruction which mimics the obstruction of metal objects. The effect of existing vehicle on the signal propagation is demonstrated based on RSSI and RMSE. The attenuation profile of vehicular obstruction on wireless signal is modeled and compared with large-scale propagation models. Results show that metal object significantly reduce transmission range and signal power. The findings may incite for future implementation of cooperative deployment program and internet of things (IoT) applications in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication.},

   abstract = {Existing global positioning technologies cannot be applied indoors, where the signal from satellites or communication towers is significantly reduced or completely absent due to signal weakening in the walls of the building. Wireless network technologies such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi can also be used in the process of local determining the mobile platforms position in industrial premises. But such methods have a problem with providing the required accuracy. The\&nbsp;relevance of these studies is associated with solving the problem of local positioning of mobile robots in a room with an accuracy of ten centimeters. The article presents a comparative analysis of determining coordinates’ principles by the AOA, TOA, TDOA and RSSI methods. It is proposed to use BLE technologies based on the RSSI data received from base stations. Using the triangulation method, formulas are obtained for solving the problem of determining the coordinates of an object moving in space. The software and hardware complex architecture has been developed. It is proposed to use ESP32 modules as base radio stations. The RSSI value is very unstable, so the positioning accuracy will depend on the number of base stations and the additional software tools used.},

WiFi Fingerprinting using a mobile phone is perhaps the most widely used method. However, this is power-hungry, and its typical positioning accuracy (2.0 to 3.0 meters) is not enough to differentiate between adjacent narrow aisles to locate items. In this paper, we present a novel (Bluetooth Low Energy) BLE Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) ranking based fingerprinting method that uses Kendall Tau Correlation Coefficient (KTCC) to correlate a new signal position with the signal strength ranking of multiple low-power iBeacon devices situated in a retail space. This offers a higher positioning accuracy and is supported in recent smartphones. An important source of error is the RSSI, which varies depending on the model and orientation of the phone. We present a novel way to mitigate this. We validated our method in a retail-like indoor space of Queen Mary Library. We achieved an average positioning error of 0.87 meters which was sufficient to differentiate between physical space aisles.},

We use a dynamic and individual-based spatial discretization, representing the physical space.

The use of the discrete choice framework is justified by its flexibility, the capacity to deal with individuals and the compatibility with agent-based simulation. The model is calibrated using data from actual pedestrian movements, manually taken from video sequences. We present two different formulations: a cross-nested logit and a mixed nested logit.

Recent researches show that Wi-Fi module in smartphones could be used to improve the traffic safety by broadcasting pedestrian position data. However, these Wi-Fi-based schemes could not achieve two-way communication with low latency, which would seriously affect the user experience. To address this issue, we propose an Android application called BLE-Horn, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to realize the bidirectional many-to-many communications. What's more, BLE also has advantages like lower battery consumption, low latency, low cost and it is also widely supported by smartphones. We redefine a Compressed GPS Information Packet (CGIP) in Bluetooth advertising packets and use a collision warning algorithm to detect the potential collision. In the real road test, we show that BLE-Horn can support at least 5 devices to communicate simultaneously between each other. The measured communication latency is as low as 56ms. With BLE-Horn running for an hour in the background, the battery level drops off only by 8.2 percents.},

On the other hand, due to the extensive use of headphones, and smart phones while walking on the road and riding a bicycle, the probability of collisions between pedestrian and bicycle increases. In this regards, it is hard to find a dedicated effort being carried out by the research community. Though Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) safety applications can be deployed, nevertheless, the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) protocol consumes a massive amount of energy at the battery operated end user. In this paper, we propose Bicycle-to-Pedestrian (B2P) safety application that can solve the aforementioned issue in more optimized manner. More specifically, we designed and implemented a B2P safety application based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and have analyzed the failure cases of our safety application and grasped the case studies to improve the reliability.},

   abstract = {Analysis of human mobility data provide us many important insights. For example, a detailed analysis of human mobility in urban space can provide important insights into gathering events. This insight is useful when addressing urban planning and public safety issues, and serves as a powerful tool for solving traffic congestion, early detection of social unrest, and so on. The analysis of human mobility in an indoor space such as in a museum exhibition, can assist us in anticipating the behavior of visitors; and in the early recognition of potential problems, such as the buildup of foot traffic at specific points. However, there is no universally accepted method for easily sensing human mobility. To address this problem, we developed a novel method to detect pedestrian flow using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Our approach is based on the assumption that a BLE beacon is always affixed to the pedestrian. Thus, the individual's velocity can be readily determined by analyzing the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of their BLE beacon. Apart from velocity, the direction of the pedestrian can also be determined by detecting their BLE beacon with multiple sensors. In this investigation, we evaluated the proposed method using both experimental real- world data and simulations. Participants with BLE beacons walked straight in a hall while the RSSI of their beacons was monitored from a moving sensor. This information was used to estimate the velocities of the beacons. We also simulated the RSSIs of the beacons and estimated their velocities under various conditions. Our results indicate that the proposed method can precisely detect the velocities of pedestrians.},

Both proposed systems were installed at a busy walkway in London Bridge station. The data were collected over a period of 2 months, after which, portions of the data set were labelled for quantitative evaluation against ground truth. In this paper, the implementation of the two different counting technologies is described, and the accuracy and limitations of both approaches under different conditions are discussed. The results show that the developed RGB-based system performs reliably across a wide range of conditions, while the depth-based approach proves to be a useful complement in conditions without significant ambient sunlight, such as underground passageways.},

   abstract = {Purpose of review: In this paper, we seek to elucidate the impact of car-free days and events on human health. Car-free days and events are often designed to alleviate the impact of transportation-related air pollution, noise, physical inactivity, traffic congestion, or other detrimental externalities of private motor vehicle travel. We reviewed existing peer-reviewed and gray literature to understand the variety of potential public health impacts that have been measured as a result of car-free days or events and associated changes in environmental exposures and lifestyles. Recent findings: The impacts of car-free days and events are highly variable and seem to depend on the scope (frequency, duration, and geographic size) and goals of each car-free day and event. Most of the existing literature measures impacts in terms of air and noise pollution and some studies focus on physical activity metrics. In some cases, car-free days and events were successful in reducing the concentration of certain air pollutants but had little or adverse impacts on the concentration of others. Often, traffic is diverted from cordoned areas to surrounding streets, displacing traffic congestion and adverse environmental exposures to other areas of a city, with potential understudied implications to environmental justice. Summary: Car-free days and events are often an attractive policy option; however, they require intensive planning to be successful. The organization and execution of car-free days and events, as well as public support and stakeholder engagement, greatly influence the level of success and the sustainability of such initiatives. Health benefits may be a palatable and convincing argument to the general public. However, very few studies focus on actual health impacts associated with car-free days and events. Future research could be most useful if it focused on measuring health outcomes associated with car-free days and events through longitudinal studies.},

It is important for decision-makers to understand the trade-offs that occur with urbanization, as it relates to ecosystem services provision, as well as the perceptions of importance of ecosystem services among a population. In this paper, we measured a)areas at environmental risk due to urban growth, b)differences in societal demand for ecosystem services between socio-demographic groups, c)perceptions of urban and agricultural impacts to ecosystem services, and d)public awareness of current ecosystem services trends, in the Boise, Idaho, metropolitan area, one of the fastest-growing areas in the United States. We applied urban growth projections to current land use-land cover, and found that agriculture is at highest risk of conversion. We then conducted over 400 face-to-face survey, measuring whether perceptions regarding ecosystem services from urban and agricultural land differ between socio-demographic groups. We found significant differences regarding perceived importance of ecosystem services. The general public placed higher importance on food production and alternative energy while experts placed higher importance on water quality and recreation. Overall, respondents perceived that urban land use negatively impacts more ecosystem services than agriculture land use. Urban areas were associated with positive impacts to local identity and recreation, while agriculture was positively associated with cultural heritage and food production. Both urban and agriculture land uses were negatively associated with water quality, air quality, and habitat for species with urban land having greater, negative impacts. Our results indicate a need to incorporate social demand for ecosystem services in urban planning, to ensure policy resilience and to appropriately address diverse perspectives.},

There are more than 1 million km of highways in the country and the search for alternative technologies to reduce emissions from the transport industry is increasing. The Blue Corridor research started to replace heavy-duty vehicles fueled by conventional diesel to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and its effect on pollutant emissions reductions. In this context, this paper aims at evaluating the atmospheric dispersion of particulate matter (PM) from road heavy-duty trucks in 12 cities in the São Paulo State, assessing the impacts of the replacement of full fleet powered by diesel to LNG and the effects on the health of the local population. The model AERMOD was used to simulate the dispersion of PM produced by heavy-duty vehicles fuel combustion and the methodology suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used to analyze the number of deaths attributed to the PM emitted. Results showed some municipalities with high PM concentrations, which exceeded the limits suggested by WHO. In terms of health issues, cardiovascular diseases in a population older than 30 years were the main cause of death from PM emissions. When it comes to fuel replacement, LNG helps to reduce PM emissions, but considering this reduction alone is not sufficient to avoid attributable deaths.},

   abstract = {Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behaviour consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to 70% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends, couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because of its “non-aerodynamic” shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among individuals.},

First, an exhaustive review of the existing route choice models for pedestrians is presented. It is shown that the existing models are mainly more stochastic and more macroscopic than required and seldom incorporate the interactions between pedestrians and traffic. Second, the existing models on pedestrians crossing behaviour are presented and assessed. It is shown that, although their approach is usually detailed, deterministic and traffic-oriented, they are mainly devoted to a local level behaviour and focus on only one type of all the potential determinants. Most importantly, these two complementary and possibly interdependent aspects of pedestrian behaviour are always examined separately. The results of this review reveal a lack of an overall and detailed consideration of pedestrian behaviour along an entire trip in urban areas. Moreover, the need for an integrated approach based on flexibility, disaggregation and more determinism is identified. Accordingly, a set of modelling techniques are discussed as a general framework for further research in the field. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Microscopic pedestrian simulation models can be used to investigate pedestrian movement at the urban block and building model scale. In order to develop, calibrate and validate such microscopic models, highly accurate and detailed data on pedestrian movement and interaction behavior (e.g. collision avoidance) is required. We present a data collection approach for studying pedestrian behavior which uses the increasingly popular low-cost sensor Microsoft Kinect. The Kinect captures both standard camera data and a three-dimensional depth map. Our human detection and tracking algorithm is based on agglomerative clustering of privacy-preserving Kinect depth data captured from an elevated view - in contrast to the lateral view used for gesture recognition in Kinect gaming applications. Our approach transforms local Kinect 3D data to a common world coordinate system in order to obtain human trajectories from multiple Kinects, which allows for a scalable and flexible capturing area. At a testbed with real-world pedestrian traffic we demonstrate that our approach can provide accurate trajectories from three Kinects with a Pedestrian Detection Rate of up to 94% and a Multiple Object Tracking Precision of 4. cm. Using a comprehensive dataset of 2674 captured human trajectories we calibrate three variations of the Social Force model. Data for model calibration and validation was recorded without any script and without actors behaving according to scripted situations. Various conditions have been covered in the dataset, such as walking at different densities, walking-stopping-walking, abrupt changes of direction and random movement. The results of our model validations indicate their particular ability to reproduce the observed pedestrian behavior in microscopic simulations.},

   abstract = {This study focuses on social pedestrian groups in public spaces and makes an effort to identify the type of social relation between the group members. As a first step for this identification problem, we focus on dyads (i.e. 2 people groups). Moreover, as a mutually exclusive categorization of social relations, we consider the domain-based approach of Bugental, which precisely corresponds to social relations of colleagues, couples, friends and families, and identify each dyad with one of those relations. For this purpose, we use anonymized trajectory data and derive a set of observables thereof, namely, inter-personal distance, group velocity, velocity difference and height difference. Subsequently, we use the probability density functions (pdf) of these observables as a tool to understand the nature of the relation between pedestrians. To that end, we propose different ways of using the pdfs. Namely, we introduce a probabilistic Bayesian approach and contrast it to a functional metric one and evaluate the performance of both methods with appropriate assessment measures. This study stands out as the first attempt to automatically recognize social relation between pedestrian groups. Additionally, in doing that it uses completely anonymous data and proves that social relation is still possible to recognize with a good accuracy without invading privacy. In particular, our findings indicate that significant recognition rates can be attained for certain categories and with certain methods. Specifically, we show that a very good recognition rate is achieved in distinguishing colleagues from leisure-oriented dyads (families, couples and friends), whereas the distinction between the leisure-oriented dyads results to be inherently harder, but still possible at reasonable rates, in particular if families are restricted to parent-child groups. In general, we establish that the Bayesian method outperforms the functional metric one due, probably, to the difficulty of the latter to learn observable pdfs from individual trajectories.},

   abstract = {Physical distancing, as a measure to contain the spreading of Covid-19, is defining a “new normal”. Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: “in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?”, “Are there repeated offenders?”, and “How are new crowd management measures performing?”. Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.},

This paper presents a probabilistic model of pedestrian behavior to signalized crosswalks. In order to model the behavior of pedestrian, we take not only pedestrian physical states but also contextual information into account. We propose a model based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network which integrates relationships among the intersection context information and the pedestrian behavior in the same way as a human. The particle filter is used to estimate the pedestrian states, including position, crossing decision and motion type. Experimental evaluation using real traffic data shows that this model is able to recognize the pedestrian crossing decision in a few seconds from the traffic signal and pedestrian position information. This information is assumed to be obtained with the development of Connected Vehicle.},

New sources of sensor information—for example, smart devices such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, etc.—can support enhanced pedestrian behavior models. The objective of this article is the development and implementation of a V2Xpedestrian collision avoidance system that uses new information sources. Methods: A literature review of existing state-of-the-art pedestrian collision avoidance systems, pedestrian behavior models in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and traffic simulations is conducted together with an analysis of existing studies on typical pedestrian patterns in traffic. Based on this analysis, possible parameters for predicting pedestrian behavior were investigated. The results led to new requirements from which a concept was developed and implemented. Results: The analysis of typical pedestrian behavior patterns in traffic situations showed the complexity of predicting pedestrian behavior. Requirements for an improved behavior prediction were derived. A concept for a V2X collision avoidance system, based on a cost function that predicts pedestrian near future presence, and its implementation is presented. The concept presented considers several challenges such as information privacy, inaccuracies of the localization, and inaccuracies of the prediction. Conclusion: A concept for an enhanced V2X pedestrian collision avoidance system was developed and introduced. The concept uses new information sources such as smart devices to improve the prediction of the pedestrian's presence in the near future and considers challenges that come along with the usage of these information sources.},

Pedestrian body orientation and head orientation are the relevant indicators of the pedestrian intention. This paper proposes an accurate estimation system to recognize the pedestrian body orientation and the pedestrian head orientation from on-board camera and inertial sensors. The proposed system discretizes the body orientation and the head orientation into 16 directions. In order to achieve the accurate orientation estimation, a novel training database is established, which includes strongly labeled data and weakly labeled data. Semi-Supervised Learning method is employed to annotate the weakly labeled data, and to generate the accurate classifier based on the proposed training database. In addition, the temporal constraint and the human physical model constraint are considered in orientation estimation, which are beneficial to the reasonable and stable result of orientation estimation for the pedestrian in image sequences. This estimated result is the orientation in camera space. The comprehension of the pedestrian behavior needs to be conducted in the real world space. Therefore, this paper proposes to model the motion of the host vehicle using inertial sensor, then transforms the estimated orientation from camera space to the real world space by considering the vehicle and pedestrian motion. The represented orientation indicates the behavior of the pedestrian more directly. Finally, a series of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pedestrian orientation system.},

   abstract = {Understanding human behaviours through video analysis has seen significant research progress in recent years with the advancement of deep learning. This topic is of great importance to the next generation of intelligent visual surveillance systems which are capable of real-time detection and analysis of human behaviours. One important application is to automatically monitor and detect individuals who are in crisis at suicide hotspots to facilitate early intervention and prevention. However, there is still a significant gap between research in human action recognition and visual video processing in general, and their application to monitor hotspots for suicide prevention. While complex backgrounds, non-rigid movements of pedestrians and limitations of surveillance cameras and multi-task requirements for a surveillance system all pose challenges to the development of such systems, a further challenge is the detection of crisis behaviours before a suicide attempt is made, and there is a paucity of datasets in this area due to privacy and confidentiality issues. Most relevant research only applies to detecting suicides such as hangings or jumps from bridges, providing no potential for early prevention. In this research, these problems are addressed by proposing a new modular design for an intelligent visual processing pipeline that is capable of pedestrian detection, tracking, pose estimation and recognition of both normal actions and high risk behavioural cues that are important indicators of a suicide attempt. Specifically, based on the key finding that human body gestures can be used for the detection of social signals that potentially precede a suicide attempt, a new 2D skeleton-based action recognition algorithm is proposed. By using a two-branch network that takes advantage of three types of skeleton-based features extracted from a sequence of frames and a stacked LSTM structure, the model predicts the action label at each time step. It achieved good performance on both the public dataset JHMDB and a smaller private CCTV footage collection on action recognition. Moreover, a logical layer, which uses knowledge from a human coding study to recognise pre-suicide behaviour indicators, has been built on top of the action recognition module to compensate for the small dataset size. It enables complex behaviour patterns to be recognised even from smaller datasets. The whole pipeline has been tested in a real-world application of suicide prevention using simulated footage from a surveillance system installed at a suicide hotspot, and preliminary results confirm its effectiveness at capturing crisis behaviour indicators for early detection and prevention of suicide.},

   abstract = {IntroductionTo combat and mitigate the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, reducing the number of social contacts within a population is highly effective. Non-pharmaceutical policy interventions, e.g. stay-at-home orders, closing schools, universities, and (non-essential) businesses, are expected to decrease pedestrian flows in public areas, leading to reduced social contacts. The extent to which such interventions show the targeted effect is often measured retrospectively by surveying behavioural changes. Approaches that use data generated through mobile phones are hindered by data confidentiality and privacy regulations and complicated by selection effects. Furthermore, access to such sensitive data is limited. However, a complex pandemic situation requires a fast evaluation of the effectiveness of the introduced interventions aiming to reduce social contacts. Location-based sensor systems installed in cities, providing objective measurements of spatial mobility in the form of pedestrian flows, are suited for such a purpose. These devices record changes in a population’s behaviour in real-time, do not have privacy problems as they do not identify persons, and have no selection problems due to ownership of a device.
ObjectiveThis work aimed to analyse location-based sensor measurements of pedestrian flows in 49 metropolitan areas at 100 locations in Germany to study whether such technology is suitable for the real-time assessment of behavioural changes during a phase of several different pandemic-related policy interventions.
MethodsSpatial mobility data of pedestrian flows was linked with policy interventions using the date as a unique linkage key. Data was visualised to observe potential changes in pedestrian flows before or after interventions. Furthermore, differences in time series of pedestrian counts between the pandemic and the pre-pandemic year were analysed.
ResultsThe sensors detected changes in mobility patterns even before policy interventions were enacted. Compared to the pre-pandemic year, pedestrian counts were 85% lower.
ConclusionsThe study illustrated the practical value of sensor-based real-time measurements when linked with non-pharmaceutical policy intervention data. This study’s core contribution is that the sensors detected behavioural changes before enacting or loosening non-pharmaceutical policy interventions. Therefore, such technologies should be considered in the future by policymakers for crisis management and policy evaluation.},

   abstract = {To investigate the impact of social groups on waiting behaviour of passengers at railway platforms a method to identify social groups through the monitoring of distances between pedestrians and the stability of those distances over time is introduced. The method allows the recognition of groups using trajectories only and thus opens up the possibility of studying crowds in public places without constrains caused by privacy protection issues. Trajectories from a railway platform in Switzerland were used to analyse the waiting behaviour of passengers in dependence of waiting time as well as the size of social groups. The analysis of the trajectories shows that the portion of passengers travelling in groups reaches up to 10% during the week and increases to 20% on the weekends. 60% of the groups were pairs, larger groups were less frequent. With increasing group size, the mean speed of the members decreases. Individuals and pairs often choose waiting spots at the sides of the stairs and in vicinity of obstacles, while larger groups wait close to the platform entries. The results indicate that passengers choose waiting places according to the following criteria and ranking: shortest ways, direction of the next intended action, undisturbed places and ensured communication. While individual passengers often wait in places where they are undisturbed and do not hinder others, the dominating comfort criterion for groups is to ensure communication. The results regarding space requirements of waiting passengers could be used for different applications. E.g. to enhance the level of service concept assessing the comfort of different types of users, to avoid temporary bottlenecks to improve the boarding and alighting process or to increase the robustness of the performance of railway platforms during peak loads by optimising the pedestrian distribution.},

   abstract = {The development of tourism in historical villages has a certain impact on the native environment, which leads to visitors occupying community public spaces relatively frequently. The design of rural public spaces, especially in relation to the street network’s spatial configuration, significantly affects how villagers interact with one another. This research investigated the influence of street network space on the regional social interaction preferences of rural community populations by applying space syntax theory. Three typical villages in southern Anhui, China, were the subject of an observation analysis of social behaviors and pedestrian volumes on street networks. Using a segment model, it was possible to determine seven spatial configuration attributes of streets, including depth to the village entrance (DtoE), connectivity, curvature, the normalized angle choice (NACH) and integration (NAIN) with two radii. A considerable joint effect of street spatial type and spatial layout attributes on the regional social interaction preferences of rural community populations was found by MANOVA and stepwise regression analysis. The sampled community tends to engage in social activities in branch streets, and the pedestrian volume contained 67.1% of all the observed people in the street networks. Streets’ spatial attributes with lower NACH or NAIN levels (less usability or accessibility) and higher DtoE or curvature levels (more privacy or deformation) have greater influences on community pedestrian volumes. Regarding street type, the in-between space was found to have the most significant effect on the pedestrian volume of the branch streets, which are the preferred zones of community populations in the context of social activities.},

   abstract = {This paper discusses the opportunities afforded by novel population sensing technologies in the field of ‘smart’ urban management. In particular, it focuses on the application of these new sources of data in retail analysis. Our goal is to integrate data derived through novel pedestrian counting and point-of-sale systems to build a statistical model that captures the relationship between retail turnover and footfall in the UK. The point-of-sales data are provided by two UK-based food \& beverage retailers. To accurately measure the pedestrian activity around retail units, we make use of the data generated by the SmartStreetSensor project: a deployment of a large network of sensors installed across 105 towns and cities in the UK that collect Wi-Fi probe requests generated by mobile devices. We propose and implement novel methods for processing these raw signals into accurate estimates of pedestrian activity without compromising participants' privacy. The resulting data is then integrated into seasonal ARIMA and dynamic regression models that can be used to predict future sales. Our results indicate that the dynamic regression model that accounts for fluctuations in footfall data outperforms seasonal ARIMA model that uses only past values and behaviours of transaction data to predict future sales. Thus, we conclude that footfall does have a strong impact on retail sales and therefore integrating footfall measures into sales forecasting can significantly improve the forecasting results. We also examine differences between the two retailers and observe a stronger correlation at the Fast Food Retailer locations compared to the correlation at Family Restaurant locations.},

Taking Singapore’s Yuhua East as a case, this study applied a qualitative approach to explore what neighborhood environmental factors influence older adults’ OOHBs. Twelve older adults were recruited for walk-along interviews through the use of purposeful convenience sampling. A content analysis was conducted using NVivo 11 via an inductive approach. Research results revealed 12 categories of environmental factors that affected older adults’ OOHBs: access to facilities (shops and services, public transit, and connectivity), pedestrian infrastructure (sidewalk quality, sheltered walkways, universal design, crossings, benches, and public toilets), aesthetics (natural elements, buildings, noise, and cleanliness), traffic safety (behavior of other road users and road width), safety from crime, wayfinding, familiarity (long-term residency and routine activities), weather, social contact, high-rise, high-density (lifts, population density, flat size, and privacy), affordability (shops and services, as well as transportation), and maintenance and upgrading. This analysis concluded that access to facilities and pedestrian infrastructure are important for older adults’ OOHBs. Considering Singapore’s weather, sheltered walkways, the proximity of facilities and connectivity should be given serious emphasis. In addition to physical factors, social contacts and the affordability of shops and services are also important.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a collision avoidance system is presented to detect red light running and warn nearby vehicles and pedestrians in real time in order to prevent possible accidents. No complex infrastructure-based solution such as those based on radars or cameras is here required. Instead, a new solution based on smartphones carried by drivers and pedestrians is proposed so that it is the device inside the vehicle violating a traffic light, the one that self-reports the offence in order to generate alerts and warn nearby vehicles and pedestrians to prevent accidents. The proposal could also be used by road authorities to collect data on traffic lights that are most frequently violated in order to define an action plan to investigate causes and look for solutions. It includes a classifier for learning and estimating driver behaviour based on collected data, which is used to predict whether he/she is about to run a red light or detect whether that has already happened. In the first case, the system broadcasts warnings directly to close vehicles and pedestrians through Wi-Fi, while in the second case, the proposal warns vehicles and pedestrians in the neighbourhood through a server. The solution also includes a prioritization system based on changing traffic lights at intersections according to the needs and characteristics of the traffic at all times, giving the top priority to emergency vehicles. Furthermore, the proposal involves the use of cryptographic schemes to protect authenticity and integrity of messages sent from traffic lights, smartphones and servers, and privacy and anonymity to promote the use of the system. A beta version with some parts of the proposal has been implemented and the obtained results are promising.},

Our approach not only enables speed estimation in the region where WiFi links are, but also in the adjacent possibly WiFi-free regions. More specifically, we use a pair of WiFi links in one region, whose RSSI measurements are then used to estimate the crowd speed, not only in this region, but also in adjacent WiFi-free regions. We first prove how the cross-correlation and the probability of crossing the two links implicitly carry key information about the pedestrian speeds and develop a mathematical model to relate them to pedestrian speeds. We then validate our approach with 108 experiments, in both indoor and outdoor, where up to 10 people walk in two adjacent areas, with a variety of speeds per region, showing that our framework can accurately estimate these speeds with only a pair of WiFi links in one region. For instance, the NMSE over all experiments is 0.18. We also evaluate our framework in a museum-type setting and estimate the popularity of different exhibits. We finally run experiments in an aisle in Costco, estimating key attributes of buyers' behaviors.},

A cognitive bias is a ‘systematic (that is, non-random and, thus, predictable) deviation from rationality in judgement or decision-making’. DP exploit them, negatively affecting the data subject’s decision-making process. In the present Article, I propose a taxonomy for DP. The overall goal of the proposed taxonomy is to help us to better understand and address the legal challenges behind DP, especially how designers affect the data subject’s decision-making process. The GDPR is silent about the exploitation of cognitive biases, manipulative interface designs and negative interferences in the decision-making process. It also misses the opportunity to unpack the fairness principle and to present occasions in which unfair practices could spread within the data protection realm, for example through design. To curb DP, fairness is a central concept, as it reflects the need to balance the asymmetries between controllers and data subjects.},

Although this tragic incident is but one among many terrible crowd disasters that occur during pilgrimage, sports events, or other mass gatherings, it stands out for it has been well documented: there were a total of seven security cameras monitoring the Loveparade and the chain of events that led to disaster was meticulously reconstructed. In this paper, we present an automatic, video-based analysis of the events in Duisburg. While physical models and simulations of human crowd behavior have been reported before, to the best of our knowledge, automatic vision systems that detect congestions and dangerous crowd turbulences in real world settings were not reported yet. Derived from lessons learned from the video footage of the Loveparade, our system is able to detect motion patterns that characterize crowd behavior in stampedes. Based on our analysis, we propose methods for the detection and early warning of dangerous situations during mass events.

   abstract = {One of the main and most effective measures to contain the recent viral outbreak is the maintenance of the so-called Social Distancing (SD). To comply with this constraint, governments are adopting restrictions over the minimum inter-personal distance between people. Given this actual scenario, it is crucial to massively measure the compliance to such physical constraint in our life, in order to figure out the reasons of the possible breaks of such distance limitations, and understand if this implies a potential threat. To this end, we introduce the Visual Social Distancing (VSD) problem, defined as the automatic estimation of the inter-personal distance from an image, and the characterization of related people aggregations. VSD is pivotal for a non-invasive analysis to whether people comply with the SD restriction, and to provide statistics about the level of safety of specific areas whenever this constraint is violated. We first point out that measuring VSD is not only a geometrical problem, but it also implies a deeper understanding of the social behaviour in the scene. The aim is to truly detect potentially dangerous situations while avoiding false alarms (e.g., a family with children or relatives, an elder with their caregivers), all of this by complying with current privacy policies. We then discuss how VSD relates with previous literature in Social Signal Processing and indicate a path to research new Computer Vision methods that can possibly provide a solution to such problem. We conclude with future challenges related to the effectiveness of VSD systems, ethical implications and future application scenarios.},

Evaluation shows state-of-the-art results on a novel data set for indoor people detection and tracking in depth images from the top-view with high perspective distortions.

   abstract = {As the number of passengers at border entry points such as airports and rail stations increases, so does the demand for seamless, secure, and fast biometric technologies for verification purposes. Although fingerprints are currently useful biometric technologies, they are intrusive and slow down the end-to-end verification process, increasing the chances of tampering. Emerging as an alternative technology, soft biometrics have proven successful for non-intrusive and rapid verification. Soft biometrics consists of a large set of features from three different modalities of the human body, including the face, body, and essential \& auxiliary attachments. This paper proposes a multi-channel soft biometrics framework that leverages soft biometrics technology over traditional biometrics. The framework encapsulates four distinct components: ApparelNet, which verifies essential and auxiliary attachments; A-Net, which measures anthropometric soft biometrics; OneDetect, which predicts global soft biometrics; and RSFS, which develops a set of highly relevant and supportive soft biometrics for verification. The proposed framework addresses several critical limitations of existing biometrics technologies during the verification process at border entry points, such as intrusive behavior, response time, biometric tampering, and privacy issues. The proposed multi-channel soft biometrics framework has been evaluated using several benchmark datasets in the field, such as Front-view Gait (FVG), Pedestrian Attribute Recognition At Far Distance (PETA), and Multimedia and Vision (MMV) Pedestrian. Using heterogeneous datasets enables the testing of each framework component or channel against numerous constrained and unconstrained scenarios. The outcome of the envisioned multi-channel soft biometrics framework is presented based on distinct outcomes from each channel, but it remains focused on determining a single cumulative verification score for verification at border control. In addition, this multi-channel soft biometrics framework has extended applications in several fields, including crowd surveillance, the fashion industry, and e-learning.},

This characteristic makes FL an ideal choice for machine learning using user data while maintaining privacy.

However, the performance of FL in edge computing environments has received limited research attention, and previous studies have not comprehensively evaluated heterogeneity aspects, such as system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and communication bandwidth. This study aims to fill this research gap by conducting experimental evaluations and detailed analyses of FL in edge computing environments. Specifically, we set up an experimental testbed based on the FL framework on the KubeEdge platform and evaluate the diverse effects of heterogeneity aspects on the model convergence time such as homogeneous versus heterogeneous hardware resources, balanced versus imbalanced data distributions, duplicate versus nonduplicate datasets, client participation ratio at each round, the client selection algorithm, and the communication bandwidth. Overall, this study contributes to the advancement of the field of FL by expanding the understanding of its performance in edge computing environments and providing guidelines for efficient and effective FL systems in heterogeneous environments, which can ultimately benefit various industries and domains.},

   abstract = {The increased mobility requirements of modern lifestyles put more stress on existing traffic infrastructure, which causes reduced traffic flow, especially in peak traffic hours. This calls for new and advanced solutions in traffic flow regulation and management. One approach towards optimisation is a transition from static to dynamic traffic light intervals, especially in spots where pedestrian crossing cause stops in road traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a smart pedestrian traffic light triggering mechanism that uses a Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar for pedestrian detection. Compared to, for example, camera-surveillance systems, radars have advantages in the ability to reliably detect pedestrians in low-visibility conditions and in maintaining privacy. Objects within a radar’s detection range are represented in a point cloud structure, in which pedestrians form clusters where they lose all identifiable features. Pedestrian detection and tracking are completed with a group tracking (GTRACK) algorithm that we modified to run on an external processor and not integrated into the used FMCW radar itself. The proposed prototype has been tested in multiple scenarios, where we focused on removing the call button from a conventional pedestrian traffic light. The prototype responded correctly in practically all cases by triggering the change in traffic signalization only when pedestrians were standing in the pavement area directly in front of the zebra crossing.},

Dash Cams are digital video recorders which can be located inside a vehicle and continuously record the view through the windscreen, thus providing objective evidence. Here we present the case of a traffic crash in which a pedestrian was hit by an articulated lorry. The analysis of a video recorded from a Dash Cam retrieved inside the vehicle during the death scene investigation (DSI) was crucial in the reconstruction of the manner of death. Indeed, the death, which was initially assumed to be accidental, was finally deemed as a suicide on the basis of the video recording, which showed an intentional and sudden rush of the victim to the middle of the roadway. Advantages and disadvantages of the use of Dash Cams will be discussed, focusing on the profound differences in the related national and international regulations. Based on the present case, in traffic crashes, the search for Dash Cams during the DSI may be recommended and the video recordings should be analyzed in the setting of a multidisciplinary and multimodal evaluation of the case, for a proper reconstruction of the facts.},

More concretely, we develop a method to infer the global number of new infections from patchy observations, by coupling ad hoc spatial models for disease transmission via respiratory droplets to detailed field-data about pedestrian trajectories and head orientations. This allows us to rank the investigated situations by the infection risks that they present; importantly, the obtained hierarchy of risks is very largely conserved across transmission models: Street cafés present the largest average rate of new infections caused by an attendant, followed by busy outdoor markets, and then metro and train stations, whereas the risks incurred while walking on fairly busy streets are comparatively quite low. While our models only approximate the actual transmission risks, their converging predictions lend credence to these findings. In situations with a moving crowd, density is the main factor influencing the estimated infection rate. Finally, our study explores the efficiency of street and venue redesigns in mitigating the viral spread: While the benefits of enforcing one-way foot traffic in (wide) walkways are unclear, changing the geometry of queues substantially affects disease transmission risks.},

In this context, intersection management (IM) as one of the most crucial elements of the transportation sector demands high attention. Today, road entities including infrastructures, vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as motorcycles, moped, scooters, pedestrians, bicycles, and other types of vehicles such as trucks, buses, cars, emergency vehicles, and railway vehicles like trains or trams are able to communicate cooperatively using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications and provide traffic safety, efficiency, infotainment and ecological improvements. In this paper, we take into account different types of intersections in terms of signalized, semi-autonomous (hybrid) and autonomous intersections and conduct a comprehensive survey on various intersection management methods for heterogeneous connected vehicles (CVs). We consider heterogeneous classes of vehicles such as road and rail vehicles as well as VRUs including bicycles, scooters and motorcycles. All kinds of intersection goals, modeling, coordination architectures, scheduling policies are thoroughly discussed. Signalized and semi-autonomous intersections are assessed with respect to these parameters. We especially focus on autonomous intersection management (AIM) and categorize this section based on four major goals involving safety, efficiency, infotainment and environment. Each intersection goal provides an in-depth investigation on the corresponding literature from the aforementioned perspectives. Moreover, robustness and resiliency of IM are explored from diverse points of view encompassing sensors, information management and sharing, planning universal scheme, heterogeneous collaboration, vehicle classification, quality measurement, external factors, intersection types, localization faults, communication anomalies and channel optimization, synchronization, vehicle dynamics and model mismatch, model uncertainties, recovery, security and privacy.},

Intelligent transport systems navigation services are now directly targeting travelers due to smartphones and their embedded sensors. However, after a decade of research, no universal personal navigation system has been successfully introduced and adopted to improve personal mobility. An analysis of the underlying reasons is conducted, looking at the engineering, human, ethical, and legal challenges. First, contrary to adopting classical mechanization equations linked to solid state physics, location technologies must address complex personal dynamics using connected objects. Second, human factors are often not sufficiently considered while designing new technologies. The needs and abilities of travelers are not systematically addressed from a user-centered perspective. Finally, people want to benefit from location-based services without sharing personal location data to uncontrolled third bodies. Europe is a pioneer in the protection of individuals from personal identification through data processing since location data has been recognized as personal data, but the challenges to enforce the regulation are numerous. The recommendation of 'privacy by design and default' is an interesting key to conceive the universal personal navigation solution. Alternative solutions are highlighted, but they definitively require a more interdisciplinary conception.},

The communications among these entities (e.g. vehicles, pedestrians, fleet management systems, and road-side infrastructure) generally take place via an open channel. In other words, such an open communication can be targeted by the adversary to eavesdrop, modify, insert fabricated (or malicious) messages, or delete any data-in-transit; thus, resulting in replay, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, privileged-insider, and other related attacks. In addition to security, anonymity and untraceability are two other important features that should be achieved in an authentication protocol. In this paper, we propose a new mutual authentication and key agreement protocol in an IoV-enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Using both formal and informal security analysis, as well as formal security verification using an automated verification tool, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against several known attacks in an IoV-enabled ITS environment. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis shows that the proposed scheme has low communication and computational overheads, and offers better security and functionality attributes in comparison to seven other competing schemes. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using NS2.},

With the increase in the demand of efficient and adoptable content delivery, information-centric networking (ICN) can be a promising solution for the future needs of the network. ICN provides a direct retrieval of content through its unique name, which is independent of locations. It also performs better in content retrieval with its in-network caching and named-based routing capabilities. Since vehicles are mobile devices, it is very crucial to select a caching node, which is secure and reliable. The security of data is quite important in the vehicular named data networking (VNDN) environment due to its vital importance in saving the life of drivers and pedestrians. To overcome the issue of security and reduce network load in addition to detect a malicious activity, we define a blockchain-based distributive trust model to achieve security, trust, and privacy of the communicating entities in VNDN, named secure vehicle communication caching (SVC-caching) mechanism for the placement of on-demand data. The proposed trust management mechanism is decentralized in nature, which is used to select a trustworthy node for cluster-based V2V communications in the VNDN environment. The SVC-caching strategy is simulated in the NS-2 simulator. The results are evaluated based on one-hop count, delivery ratio, cache hit ratio, and malicious node detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed technique improves the performance based on the selected parameters.},

The use of vehicle sensor data has enabled vehicles to communicate with other entities in the connected vehicle ecosystem, such as the cloud, road infrastructure, other vehicles, pedestrians, and smart grids, using either cellular or wireless networks. This vehicle data are distributed, private, and vulnerable, which can compromise the safety and security of vehicles and their passengers. It is therefore necessary to design an access control mechanism around the vehicle data’s unique attributes and distributed nature. Since connected vehicles operate in a highly dynamic environment, it is important to consider context information such as location, time, and frequency when designing a fine-grained access control mechanism. This leads to our research question: How can Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) fulfill connected vehicle requirements of Signal Access Control (SAC), Time-Based Access Control (TBAC), Location-Based Access Control (LBAC), and Frequency-Based Access Control (FBAC)? To address the issue, we propose a data flow model based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) called eXtensible Access Control Markup Language for Mobility (XACML4M). XACML4M adds additional components to the standard eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) to satisfy the identified requirements of SAC, TBAC, LBAC, and FBAC in connected vehicles. Specifically, these are: Vehicle Data Environment (VDE) integrated with Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), Time Extensions, GeoLocation Provider, Polling Frequency Provider, and Access Log Service. We implement a prototype based on these four requirements on a Raspberry Pi 4 and present a proof-of-concept for a real-world use case. We then perform a functional evaluation based on the authorization policies to validate the XACML4M data flow model. Finally, we conclude that our proposed XACML4M data flow model can fulfill all four of our identified requirements for connected vehicles.},

Methods: This paper starts with a literature overview on research related to safety applications using communication between vehicle and VRU, and an analysis of the different use cases for C-ITS for VRUs. An architecture is developed, starting from an architecture of C-ITS systems and incorporating the different alternative configuration for VRUs. Starting from the architecture and the use cases, the requirements for VRU devices are defined. Finally, a roadmap regarding C-ITS applications for VRUs is developed. Results: C-ITS technologies allow to communicate with low latency in highly dynamic environments. C-ITS will be integrated in vehicles and can also become available for VRUs, either as an application on a smartphone or as a dedicated device, which can be integrated in the VRU’s vehicle. Two levels of use cases can be identified: awareness of the presence of VRUs near potentially dangerous situations, and collision risk warning, based on trajectories of the road users. A roadmap was developed aligned with the roadmap of the automotive industry. Conclusions: Awareness related use cases are relatively close to the market, as they do not put stringent requirements to the (localization) sensors at infrastructure or vehicles. For the collision risk warning use case, the technical requirements for VRU devices towards sensor accuracy and calculation capabilities are challenging. Other challenges are power consumption, context sensitivity, channel congestion, privacy and security of messages. Standardisation of the messages exchanged between VRUs and other road users and infrastructure is a key issue.},

   abstract = {Next-generation audio-visual (AV) hearing aids stand as a major enabler to realize more intelligible audio. However, high data rate, low latency, low computational complexity, and privacy are some of the major bottlenecks to the successful deployment of such advanced hearing aids. To address these challenges, we propose an integration of 5G Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN), Internet of Things (IoT), and strong privacy algorithms to fully benefit from the possibilities these technologies have to offer. Existing audio-only hearing aids are known to perform poorly in noisy situations where overwhelming noise is present. Current devices make the signal more audible but remain deficient in restoring intelligibility. Thus, there is a need for hearing aids that can selectively amplify the attended talker or filter out acoustic clutter. The proposed 5G IoT-enabled AV hearing-aid framework transmits the encrypted compressed AV information and receives encrypted enhanced reconstructed speech in real time to address cybersecurity attacks such as location privacy and eavesdropping. For security implementation, a real-time lightweight AV encryption is proposed, based on a piece-wise linear chaotic map (PWLSM), Chebyshev map, and a secure hash and S-Box algorithm. For speech enhancement, the received secure AV (including lip-reading) information in the cloud is used to filter noisy audio using both deep learning and analytical acoustic modelling. To offload the computational complexity and real-time optimization issues, the framework runs deep learning and big data optimization processes in the background, on the cloud. The effectiveness and security of the proposed 5G-IoT-enabled AV hearing-aid framework are extensively evaluated using widely known security metrics. Our newly reported, deep learning-driven lip-reading approach for speech enhancement is evaluated under four different dynamic real-world scenarios (cafe, street, public transport, pedestrian area) using benchmark Grid and ChiME3 corpora. Comparative critical analysis in terms of both speech enhancement and AV encryption demonstrates the potential of the envisioned technology to deliver high-quality speech reconstruction and secure mobile AV hearing aid communication. We believe our proposed 5G IoT enabled AV hearing aid framework is an effective and feasible solution and represents a step change in the development of next-generation multimodal digital hearing aids. The ongoing and future work includes more extensive evaluation and comparison with benchmark lightweight encryption algorithms and hardware prototype implementation.},

   abstract = {Crowd density analysis is a crucial component in visual surveillance mainly for security monitoring. This paper proposes a novel approach for crowd density measure, in which local information at pixel level substitutes a global crowd level or a number of people per-frame. The proposed approach consists of generating automatic crowd density maps using local features as an observation of a probabilistic density function. It also involves a feature tracking step which excludes feature points belonging to the background. This process is favorable for the later density estimation as the influence of features irrelevant to the underlying crowd density is removed. Since the proposed crowd density conveys rich information about the local distributions of persons in the scene, we employ it as a side information to complement other tasks related to video surveillance in crowded scenes. First, since conventional detection and tracking methods are hard to be scalable to crowds, we use the proposed crowd density to enhance detection and tracking in videos of high density crowds. Second, we employ the local density together with regular motion patterns as crowd attributes for high level applications such as crowd change detection and event recognition. Third, we investigate the concept of crowd context-aware privacy protection by adjusting the obfuscation level according to the crowd density. In the experimental results, our proposed approach for crowd density estimation is evaluated on videos from different datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of feature tracks for crowd measurements. Moreover, the employment of crowd density in other applications demonstrate good performances for detection, tracking, behavior analysis, and privacy preservation.},

Drawing from social norms theory, we examine how the multiple aspects of online crowds affect their self-disclosure behaviors as they provide online reviews and investigate the extent to which prior experience moderates this relationship. Our analysis of data from a leading apparel rental site in the United States uncovers that individuals are inclined to conform to the self-disclosure behaviors of a crowd and divulge more personal information as self-disclosure variance within the group increases. Conversely, individuals are more likely to conceal personal information as a review page becomes crowded. The findings reveal that a reviewer’s prior experience of writing a review on the website weakens conformity behavior and reduces the effects of crowdedness. The prior experience also positively interacts with self-disclosure variance in a crowd. Based on these results, we present theoretical implications to literature on social norms and privacy, prior experience, and online reviews. This study also has managerial implications for firms interested in content generation by online reviewers and in review systems where user-generated content is essential.},

Altman introduced the term “privacy” as a desired level of personal space that humans need to feel psychologically comfortable. The author also mentioned the dynamic process of boundary regulation that can be accompanied by the increase in conflict tension in the confined groups. In our study with short-term chamber isolation ESKIS, we analyzed behavior, crew interactions, and psychological state of a mixed-gender crew with none or minimal previous isolation experience (4 males and 2 females) who spent 14 days in a small chamber of 50 m3. The study confirmed that the pre-isolation period was particularly stressful for the subjects who felt also significant anxiety during the first days of isolation. Also, some mood and sleep disturbances were detected under isolation and crowding. Psychological stress made the crew more cohesive; they demonstrated the increase in common values. Extraverted subjects who could obtain social support from their partners and Mission Control’s duty teams were less interested in psychological support via VR.},

Current traffic information services employ participatory sensing and crowd sourcing techniques to provide dynamic traffic information consisting of estimated travel times and congestion warnings. In this paper we propose the crowd sensing system based on smartphones and integrated GPS and accelerometer sensors, to capture dynamic, short-lasting traffic events and drivers' aggressive and risky behavior like excessive breaking, sudden lane change, open turns, speed excess and route deviations. These traffic events can be categorized as risky driving situations or near accidents and are typically not included in any official traffic statistics. The system uses crowd intelligence based on participatory sensing paradigm and collaborative mechanisms to detect important traffic events/situations. It provides proactive notification and recommendations to drivers in the vicinity of, or on the route to reported events. The proposed crowd sensing system ensures information reliability through space-time clustering of reported events/situations while preserving drivers' privacy. We perform the evaluation of our system that demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of advanced navigation service based on it, that uses collected dynamic traffic events to provide warning and notifications to drivers and safest route navigation. This novel functionality of a navigation service enhances drivers' situational awareness, increasing safety and effectiveness of the traffic.},

As countries aim to recover their economies, there is an increasing need for smart city solutions, such as crowd monitoring systems, to ensure public safety both during and after the pandemic. This paper presents the design and implementation of a real-time crowd monitoring system using existing public Wi-Fi infrastructure. The proposed system employs a three-tiered architecture, including the sensing domain for data acquisition, the communication domain for data transfer, and the computing domain for data processing, visualization, and analysis. Wi-Fi access points were used as sensors that continuously monitored the crowd and uploaded data to the server. To protect the privacy of the data, encryption algorithms were employed during data transmission. The system was implemented in the Sri Chiang Mai Smart City, where nine Wi-Fi access points were installed in nine different locations along the Mekong River. The system provides real-time crowd density visualizations. Historical data were also collected for the analysis and understanding of urban behaviors. A quantitative evaluation was not feasible due to the uncontrolled environment in public open spaces, but the system was visually evaluated in real-world conditions to assess crowd density, rather than represent the entire population. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of leveraging existing public Wi-Fi infrastructure for crowd monitoring in uncontrolled, real-world environments. The monitoring system is readily accessible and does not require additional hardware investment or maintenance. The collected dataset is also available for download. In addition to COVID-19 pandemic management, this technology can also assist government policymakers in optimizing the use of public space and urban planning. Real-time crowd density data provided by the system can assist route planners or recommend points of interest, while information on the popularity of tourist destinations enables targeted marketing.},

   abstract = {The home of the future will surely be a technologically richer environment, offering tens or even hundreds of network services ranging from the simple continuous transmission of video data streams to a complex system of house energy management. The typical elements within the house that can be controlled are: lighting, windows and shutters, doors, speakers, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, appliances (refrigerator, washing machine, ovens, etc.), audio-video systems, burglar alarms and fire alarms, telecommunications. Many operational control sequences can be automated to prevent the user from making the effort to adapt to systems. Some of these services will be provided by devices inside the home and others by external providers. So a great improvement to this control can happen by adding a certain degree of "intelligence"to the system allowing it to recognize recurring activities, dangerous or unusual situations in order to anticipate health problems or special needs of users within of the House. These problems can be addressed by monitoring the activities of regular users, which allows the creation of rules-based profiles, in order to grasp and formalize their normal behavior. In order to realize Smart Home systems through IoT, the problem of localization within closed spaces remains constant: in fact, efficiency is put to the test by all those that are the vertical closures (opinions and fixtures) with which optimal transmission with the outside is possible. The Beacon technology was used to solve the indoor transmission. The Beacon is a device that through Bluetooth Low Energy technology, is able to transmit information to mobile devices with a certain range of action. In this paper, for the Beacons, different methods of localization in a closed environment are tested and demonstrated through a mapping of the signal in a room, has led to satisfactory results. The relationship between the used beacon and area covered by their own signal is also identified in a beacon every 5 square meters; this result allows us to have an idea of the costs of mapping a given environment and the invasion of the technology inside it. A further raised question of the relationship between used beacon and covered area was how and where to place the beacons inside the room; The less satisfactory result concerns the error, albeit low, detected in the pure localization (ie without the help of external information such as the initial position) in a closed environment.},

However, thus far, privacy concerns have not been explicitly considered in software engineering processes when designing IoT applications. With the advent of behaviour driven security mechanisms, failing to address privacy concerns in the design of IoT applications can also have security implications. In this paper, we explore how a Privacy-by-Design (PbD) framework, formulated as a set of guidelines, can help software engineers integrate data privacy considerations into the design of IoT applications. We studied the utility of this PbD framework by studying how software engineers use it to design IoT applications. We also explore the challenges in using the set of guidelines to influence the IoT applications design process. In addition to highlighting the benefits of having a PbD framework to make privacy features explicit during the design of IoT applications, our studies also surfaced a number of challenges associated with the approach. A key finding of our research is that the PbD framework significantly increases both novice and expert software engineers’ ability to design privacy into IoT applications.},

   abstract = {The internet of things (IoT) has prepared the way for a highly linked world, in which everything is interconnected, and information exchange has become more easily accessible via the internet, making it feasible for various applications that enrich the quality of human life. Despite such a potential vision, users’ privacy on these IoT devices is a significant concern. IoT devices are subject to threats from hackers and malware due to the explosive expansion of IoT and its use in commerce and critical infrastructures. Malware poses a severe danger to the availability and reliability of IoT devices. If left uncontrolled, it can have profound implications, as IoT devices and smart services can collect personally identifiable information (PII) without the user’s knowledge or consent. These devices often transfer their data into the cloud, where they are stored and processed to provide the end users with specific services. However, many IoT devices do not meet the same security criteria as non-IoT devices; most used schemes do not provide privacy and anonymity to legitimate users. Because there are so many IoT devices, so much malware is produced every day, and IoT nodes have so little CPU power, so antivirus cannot shield these networks from infection. Because of this, establishing a secure and private environment can greatly benefit from having a system for detecting malware in IoT devices. In this paper, we will analyze studies that have used ML as an approach to solve IoT privacy challenges, and also investigate the advantages and drawbacks of leveraging data in ML-based IoT privacy approaches. Our focus is on using ML models for detecting malware in IoT devices, specifically spyware, ransomware, and Trojan horse malware. We propose using ML techniques as a solution for privacy attack detection and test pattern generation in the IoT. The ML model can be trained to predict behavioral architecture. We discuss our experiments and evaluation using the “MalMemAnalysis” datasets, which focus on simulating real-world privacy-related obfuscated malware. We simulate several ML algorithms to prove their capabilities in detecting malicious attacks against privacy. The experimental analysis showcases the high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting obfuscated and concealed malware, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 99.50%, and would be helpful in safeguarding an IoT network from malware. Experimental analysis and results are provided in detail.},

   abstract = {There are currently two approaches to anonymization: "utility first" (use an anonymization method with suitable utility features, then empirically evaluate the disclosure risk and, if necessary, reduce the risk by possibly sacrificing some utility) or "privacy first" (enforce a target privacy level via a privacy model, e.g., k-anonymity or ε-differential privacy, without regard to utility). To get formal privacy guarantees, the second approach must be followed, but then data releases with no utility guarantees are obtained. Also, in general it is unclear how verifiable is anonymization by the data subject (how safely released is the record she has contributed?), what type of intruder is being considered (what does he know and want?) and how transparent is anonymization towards the data user (what is the user told about methods and parameters used?). We show that, using a generally applicable reverse mapping transformation, any anonymization for microdata can be viewed as a permutation plus (perhaps) a small amount of noise; permutation is thus shown to be the essential principle underlying any anonymization of microdata, which allows giving simple utility and privacy metrics. From this permutation paradigm, a new privacy model naturally follows, which we call (d, v, f)-permuted privacy. The privacy ensured by this method can be verified by each subject contributing an original record (subject-verifiability) and also at the data set level by the data protector. We then proceed to define a maximum-knowledge intruder model, which we argue should be the one considered in anonymization. Finally, we make the case for anonymization transparent to the data user, that is, compliant with Kerckhoff's assumption (only the randomness used, if any, must stay secret).},

This study aimed to meet three objectives: to trace the development of the PBS worldwide from 1997 to 2021, to report on its varied uses and to analyse the scientific validation of the different dimensions of pedestrian behaviour reflected by the PBS and its derivatives. Design/methodology: In this systematic literature review, we selected all works that cited the 2013 founding study of the PBS as well as all publications that cited the 2017 US validation of PBS which was frequently replicated around the world. We conducted an online database search using Web of Science, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and PubMed. After excluding duplicates, 116 studies were identified. A total of 30 studies were selected to meet our first two objectives and 14 studies were selected to meet our third objective. Results: Over time, the PBS has undergone many changes. Overall, we found differences in the scientific validation of this questionnaire depending on the version used, the validation tests performed and the population studied. The original version of the PBS and its Turkish adaptation proved most appropriate for assessing the transgressions dimension. The American version of the PBS proved a suitable alternative but it is more suited to assessing the two independent dimensions of violations and errors. The Chinese version of the PBS (CPBS) proved unsuitable for assessing the lapses dimension, while the original version of the PBS emerged as the best option for assessing aggressive behaviours. The positive behaviour dimension presented many validation difficulties but its assessment by the CPBS seems to be the most appropriate option. Conclusion: As no systematic review of the PBS has been conducted before, researchers can now make an informed choice of methodology quickly and be guided by our recommendations regarding the use and possible improvements of the different validated versions.},

Results showed that the addition of perceived behavioral control led to significant increments in the amount of explained variance in intentions, thereby supporting the theory. The relation between subjective norms and behavioral intentions was consistently stronger than that between attitudes toward behaviors and behavioral intentions. Analyses of variance differentiated demographic subgroups of drivers in terms of behavioral beliefs, outcome evaluations, normative beliefs, motivation to comply, and control beliefs.},

La actitud hacia la conducta, la norma subjetiva y el control percibido explican alrededor de un 40% de la varianza en la intención de realizar el comportamiento infractor (R Múltiple= .6266; R2=.3927; F=30.609; Sig.F p<.0000). También se registra que el comportamiento peatonal difiere significativamente (p<.001) en las tres variables del modelo para los jóvenes vs. los adultos, mostrándose que los primeros tienen una actitud más positiva hacia el comportamiento infractor, perciben la norma subjetiva como menos inhibidora de la transgresión, aparecen con un menor control sobre el comportamiento infractor y con una intención conductual de mayor probabilidad a desarrollarlo. El resultado de la Escala de Comportamiento Peatonal muestra que los peatones jóvenes cometen más transgresiones, errores y lapsus al transitar que los adultos (p<.001).},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop and validate a self-reporting scale to measure injury risk behaviors among pedestrians of all ages. The Pedestrian Behavior Scale (PBS) was developed that included 47 items enabling respondents to evaluate the frequency with which they had different types of pedestrian behaviors. The validation study was carried out on 343 participants (126 men and 217 women) between the ages of 15 and 78. Factor analyses were used to differentiate between 4 axes. Factor 1, "transgres-sion", included items concerning offence of legal rules and errors. Factor 2 included "lapses" items. Factor 3 comprised "aggressive behavior" items and factor 4 included "positive behavior" items. A revised version of the PBS with 20 items was produced by selecting those items that loaded most strongly on the four factors. The 20-item version had good internal reliability. The effects of demographic and mobility variables on the PBS scores were investigated. This instrument will be useful in measuring the frequency of these different types of behaviors among the pedestrians who are most at risk, analyzing the psychological factors used to predict PBS scores and thus better adapt preventive actions to the different populations of vulnerable road users of all ages.},

   abstract = {Based on the theory of planned behavior, pedestrians' attitudes towards traffic violations and self-ratings of violations, errors and lapses were measured amongst a sample of 146 pedestrians. The evaluation of the planned behavior model using EQS showed a significant fit (v 2 ð11Þ ¼ 16:04 p ¼ 0:14; normal fit index ¼ 0:937). The reported violations, errors and lapses appears causally related to the intention to violate regulations , and this in turn with positive attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. Young people have a more positive attitude towards committing violations as pedestrians than adults and perceive the subjective norm to be less inhibitory, have less control over violations, have a more positive intention to commit violations, and report more violations, errors, and lapses than adults. Men report more frequent violations of the traffic rules than women do. The conclusion is drawn that pedestrians, and in particular young males, are at least in part responsible for the high accident rates and remedial actions are suggested.},

   abstract = {Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behaviour consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to 70% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends, couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because of its “non-aerodynamic” shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among individuals.},

   abstract = {Restrictions of pedestrian flow could be triggered by directional changes, merging of streams and other changes or disturbances causing effects similar to bottlenecks given by geometrical narrowings. In this contribution we analyze empirically how the types of the changes or disturbances influence the capacity of a facility. For this purpose four types of facilities including a short narrowing, a long narrowing, a corner and a T-junction are investigated. It is found that the reduction of pedestrian flow depends on the shape and the length of the narrowing. The maximum observed flow of the corner (about 1.45 (m s)-1) is the lowest in all facilities studied, whereas that of the short narrowing is highest. The finding indicates that the usage of an unique fundamental diagram for the description of pedestrian flow at different kind of geometrical narrowings is limited.},

Beside giving access to the train platforms (it passes underneath the railways), the walkway plays an important connection role in the city. Several crowding scenarios occur during the day, including high- and low-density dynamics in uni- and bi-directional regimes. In this paper we discuss our recording technique and we illustrate preliminary data analyses. Via fundamental diagrams-like representations we report pedestrian velocities and fluxes vs. pedestrian density. Considering the density range $0$ - $1.1\,$ped/m$^2$, we find that at densities lower than $0.8\,$ped/m$^2$ pedestrians in unidirectional flows walk faster than in bidirectional regimes. On the opposite, velocities and fluxes for even bidirectional flows are higher above $0.8\,$ped/m$^2$.},

   abstract = {India has witnessed higher level of mobility at urban as well as intercity segments due to improvisation of socio-economic conditions in last two decades. Even though, majority of the intercity travel is made by road based modes, number of passengers traveling by railways is significant on certain highly industrialized corridors. Collection and dispersal of passengers on railway platforms take place through stairways and foot over bridges. Design of these vital elements needs to incorporate the behavior of pedestrian flow to ensure desired level of service as well as safety in case of emergency. As reported in literature, pedestrian flow characteristics are influenced by number of attributes of pedestrian like age, gender, physical dimensions, luggage carried, group size, activity while walking, purpose in addition to the other attributes such as space availability, direction of movement and schedule of train as well. Very limited efforts are made in India to study pedestrian flow behavior in this context. Fluctuations in pedestrian flow depends on schedule of arrival and departure of the train, particularly during the peak hours as there is large passenger flow in short interval of time. Due to limited capacity of pedestrian facility, especially staircases, desired speed cannot be achieved by the pedestrian while walking in crowd with luggage. Higher walking speed is reported on downstairs than upstairs with reduction in speed with increase in pedestrian density. Most of the pedestrian facilities are designed by rule of thumb, especially stairways, largely governed by ideal pedestrian behavior. However behavior of individual pedestrian and hence flow at rail transit stations are dynamic on stairways depending on the factors mentioned above. Present study attempts to highlight the results of the study carried out on pedestrian flow behavior at Vadodara railway station in the state of Gujarat, India. Total 3411 number of pedestrian data are extracted by employing videographic technique. Flow models of speed- flow, speed-density and flow-density are developed to illustrate behaviour of pedestrian stream on stairways of different dimensions.},

This paper's aim is to provide quantitative insights into the influence of group size and composition of demographic characteristics on the distance headway pedestrians adhere to with respect to respectively other groups and other individuals within their own group, during bi-directional crowd movements. It is concluded that the composition of age and genders within a group, as well as the total size of the group influences also the distance headway pedestrians adhere during large crowd movements. As such, the presence of groups changes the dynamics of the crowd movements. This can result in a decrease of the capacity of the infrastructure.},

   abstract = {Disorientation has many costs. It may lead to physical fatigue, stress, and frustration and can also jeopardize people's safety. Designing wayfinding aids to fit people's needs can facilitate their environmental knowledge acquisition and, therefore, improve their wayfinding performance. The scope of this article is human wayfinding in unfamiliar buildings, considering only individual pedestrian movement in an immersive virtual environment. The purpose is to investigate the use of external information at a higher level of awareness (e.g., signage) as a wayfinding aid, as well as the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) to study indoor wayfinding. Fifty-four volunteers accomplished a wayfinding task (i.e., finding a room from the building's entrance) within a virtual building, employing two types of signage systems (i.e., vertical and horizontal conditions). A neutral condition (no signage) was also considered as a control condition to be used as a baseline. Aside from the success of the wayfinding task (getting to the destination), other performance metrics (distance traveled, time spent, number of pauses, and average speed) were analyzed and compared. Although the differences found are not statistically significant, findings suggest that participants assigned to the horizontal condition traveled smaller distances, spent less time, made fewer pauses, and moved at higher average speed than those assigned to vertical and neutral conditions. Gender-related differences were found statistically significant only in the average speed variable (females were faster than males).},

   abstract = {Advanced mobile devices equipped with positioning technologies have shown great promise in location-enabled applications, especially navigation systems. A spatial database is one necessary component of a navigation system as it provides the base data to perform navigation functions. Currently, pedestrian networks are not widely available for many areas, in part due to the relatively lower demand compared to road networks for car navigation and other applications. This lack of available pedestrian networks calls for the development of efficient and cost-effective techniques appropriate for collecting and constructing pedestrian networks. This chapter discusses a pedestrian network data model and an algorithm for automatically constructing pedestrian networks using GPS traces collected through collaborative mapping. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a high potential to generate sidewalks and crosswalks from collected GPS traces.},

Errors in the planning phase can cause unexpected crowd dynamics and lead to stampedes with lethal consequences. We deployed an official app for Züri Fäscht 2013 - the largest Swiss event - over a period of three days. The app offered information about the festival and featured a background localization allowing us to collect continuously the visitor position. With 56,000 app downloads and 28,000 users contributing 25M location updates in total, we obtained a large scale dataset. By aggregation of location points complex crowd dynamics can be captured during the entire festival. In this paper we present the data collection for Züri Fäscht 2013 and best practices to acquire as many contributing users as possible for such an event. Furthermore, we show the potential of aggregated location data and visualize relevant parameters that can serve as tool for analysis and planning of program and perimeter design. © 2014 IEEE.},

   abstract = {This study examines the feasibility of using revealed preference GPS data collected through a smartphone-based travel survey and discrete choice modeling techniques to determine pedestrians’ preferences towards street infrastructure, built environment, and land use. Smartphone GPS points were collected after 50 m of travel and had a horizontal spatial accuracy of 30 m or less. A path size logit model with stochastic route choice generation choice set was used for this model. The results of the model showed that distance, the number of turns, the number of signalized intersections, and distance along links with sidewalks on both sides of the street were significant variables in the route choice model. Turns are found to be equivalent to an additional 32 m, signalized intersections are equivalent to a reduction of 34 m, and travel along streets with sidewalks on both sides of the road is evaluated as 33% shorter than streets with other sidewalk conditions. While the dataset used for this study was relatively small (776 trip observations), these results are consistent with other pedestrian route choice studies which support the viability of using smartphone GPS data for future pedestrian route choice studies.},

The highest resolution GPS data can characterize micro-mobility patterns and pedestrians’ micro-motives in relation to a small-scale urban context. Purposed-based recurrent mobility data inside people’s neighbourhoods is an important source in these sorts of studies. However, micro-mobility around people’s homes is generally unavailable, and if data exists, it is generally not shareable often due to privacy issues. Citizen science and its public involvement practices in scientific research are valid options to circumvent these challenges and provide meaningful datasets for walkable cities. The study presents GPS records from single-day home-to-school pedestrian mobility of 10 schools in the Barcelona Metropolitan area (Spain). The research provides pedestrian mobility from an age-homogeneous group of people. The study shares processed records with specific filtering, cleaning, and interpolation procedures that can facilitate and accelerate data usage.

We conducted GPS experiments to observe visitors’ choice of walking route—pedestrian volume and visit duration—and the questionnaire survey to obtain their records of shopping on where and how much they spent in the Sinchon retail district of Seoul, South Korea. We then employed a path analysis to assess the causal relationship between the built environment, walking behavior, and shopping behavior. We found that pedestrians prefer streets with safety from vehicles, high design quality; higher hierarchy, centrality, and provision of resting places or other street amenities; and that all of these variables also increase pedestrian's visit duration and induce spending at stores on the street. This study would provide design guidelines to municipalities or private retailers looking to revitalize retail districts through environmental improvements.},

Both communication systems leak information to the surroundings during operation. This information has been used for tracking and crowd density estimations in literature. However, an estimation of pedestrian flows has not yet been evaluated with respect to a known ground truth and, thus, a reliable adoption in real world scenarios is rather difficult. With this paper, we fill in this gap. Using ground truth provided by the security check process at a major German airport, we discuss the quality and feasibility of pedestrian flow estimations for both Wi- Fi and Bluetooth captures. We present and evaluate three approaches in order to improve the accuracy in comparison to a naive count of captured MAC addresses. Such counts only showed an impractical Pearson correlation of 0.53 for Bluetooth and 0.61 for Wi-Fi compared to ground truth. The presented extended approaches yield a superior correlation of 0.75 in best case. This indicates a strong correlation and an improvement of accuracy. Given these results, the presented approaches allow for a practical estimation of pedestrian flows.},

Sustainable urban development is crucial, therefore, for ensuring the quality of life of the world's people. Forests and trees in cities, if properly managed, can make important contributions to the planning, design and management of sustainable, resilient urban landscapes. They can help make cities more pleasant, attractive and healthy places in which to live, as well as safer, wealthier and more diverse. A few years ago, FAO initiated a collaborative process to develop voluntary guidelines aimed at optimizing the contributions of forests and trees to sustainable urban development. Scientists, practitioners and public administrators from cities worldwide were brought together to discuss the elements and key challenges of urban forestry, and a smaller team of experts was assembled to distil this vast knowledge. This document is the ultimate result of that process. Intended for a global audience comprising urban decision-makers, civil servants, policy advisors and other stakeholders, it will assist in the development of urban and peri-urban forests that help meet the present and future needs of cities for forest products and ecosystem services. These guidelines will also help increase community awareness of the contributions that forests and trees can make to improving quality of life, and of their essential role in global sustainability.},

   abstract = {Trophic rewilding is an ecological restoration strategy that uses species introductions to restore top-down trophic interactions and associated trophic cascades to promote self-regulating biodiverse ecosystems. Given the importance of large animals in trophic cascades and their widespread losses and resulting trophic downgrading, it often focuses on restoring functional megafaunas. Trophic rewilding is increasingly being implemented for conservation, but remains controversial. Here, we provide a synthesis of its current scientific basis, highlighting trophic cascades as the key conceptual framework, discussing the main lessons learned from ongoing rewilding projects, systematically reviewing the current literature, and highlighting unintentional rewilding and spontaneous wildlife comebacks as underused sources of information. Together, these lines of evidence show that trophic cascades may be restored via species reintroductions and ecological replacements. It is clear, however, that megafauna effects may be affected by poorly understood trophic complexity effects and interactions with landscape settings, human activities, and other factors. Unfortunately, empirical research on trophic rewilding is still rare, fragmented, and geographically biased, with the literature dominated by essays and opinion pieces.Wehighlight the need for applied programs to include hypothesis testing and science-based monitoring, and outline priorities for future research, notably assessing the role of trophic complexity, interplay with landscape settings, land use, and climate change, as well as developing the global scope for rewilding and tools to optimize benefits and reduce human-wildlife conflicts. Finally, we recommend developing a decision framework for species selection, building on functional and phylogenetic information and with attention to the potential contribution from synthetic biology.},

   abstract = {Sustaining wildlife populations, which provide both ecosystem services and disservices, represents a worldwide conservation challenge. The ecosystem services and Ostrom's social–ecological systems frameworks have been adopted across natural and social sciences to characterize benefits from nature. Despite their generalizability, individually they do not include explicit tools for addressing the sustainable management of many wildlife populations. For instance, Ostrom's framework does not specifically address competing perspectives on wildlife, whereas the ecosystem services framework provides a limited representation of the social and governance context wherein such competing perspectives are embedded. We developed a unified social–ecological framework of ecosystem disservices and services (SEEDS) that advances both frameworks by explicitly acknowledging the importance of competing wildlife perspectives embedded in the social and governance contexts. The SEEDS framework emulates the hierarchical structure of Ostrom's social–ecological systems, but adds subsystems reflecting heterogeneous stakeholder views and experiences of wildlife-based services and disservices. To facilitate operationalizing SEEDS and further broader analyses across human–wildlife systems, we devised a list of variables to describe SEEDS subsystems, such as types and level of services and disservices, cost and benefit sharing, and social participation of stakeholders. Steps to implement SEEDS involve engaging local communities and stakeholders to define the subsystems, analyze interactions and outcomes, and identify leverage points and actions to remedy unwanted outcomes. These steps connect SEEDS with other existing approaches in social–ecological research and can guide analyses across systems or within individual systems to provide new insights and management options for sustainable human–wildlife coexistence.},

Research for over two decades has resulted in a large literature, yet there is little consensus on the applicability or even the existence of general principles or broad considerations that could guide landscape conservation. We assess six major themes in the ecology and conservation of landscapes. We identify 13 important issues that need to be considered in developing approaches to landscape conservation. They include recognizing the importance of landscape mosaics (including the integration of terrestrial and aquatic areas), recognizing interactions between vegetation cover and vegetation configuration, using an appropriate landscape conceptual model, maintaining the capacity to recover from disturbance and managing landscapes in an adaptive framework. These considerations are influenced by landscape context, species assemblages and management goals and do not translate directly into on-the-ground management guidelines but they should be recognized by researchers and resource managers when developing guidelines for specific cases. Two crucial overarching issues are: (i) a clearly articulated vision for landscape conservation and (ii) quantifiable objectives that offer unambiguous signposts for measuring progress. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Seven different urban ecosystems have been identified: street trees; lawns/parks; urban forests; cultivated land; wetlands; lakes/sea; and streams. These systems generate a range of ecosystem services. In this paper, six local and direct services relevant for Stockholm are addressed: air filtration, micro climate regulation, noise reduction, rainwater drainage, sewage treatment, and recreational and cultural values. It is concluded that the locally generated ecosystem services have a substantial impact on the quality-of-life in urban areas and should be addressed in land-use planning.},

The studies on carabids and butterflies illustrated the relative importance of habitat quality on individual sites as opposed to site location within the conurbation. This suggests that dispersal for most of our urban species is not a limiting factor in population persistence, although elements of the woodland carabid fauna did appear to have some geographical structuring. Theoretical models suggested that dormice and water voles may depend on linear habitats for dispersal. The models also indicated that other groups, such as small and medium sized mammals, may use corridors, although field-based research did not provide any evidence to suggest that plants or invertebrates use urban greenways for dispersal. This finding indicates the importance of identifying a target species or group of species for urban greenways intended as dispersal routeways rather than as habitat in their own right. Their importance for most groups is rather that greenways provide a chain of different habitats permeating the urban environment.

   abstract = {Animal movement can be significantly altered in human-dominated landscapes such as urban and peri-urban areas, where habitat is often fragmented and/or linear. Knowledge regarding how wildlife respond to anthropogenic change is vital for informing conservation efforts in such landscapes, including the design of nature reserves and wildlife corridors. To better understand how threatened species persist and behave within human-dominated landscapes, we examined the home range and space use of the nationally endangered southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus obesulus in peri-urban Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city. Specifically, we examined whether: (1) bandicoots were confined to linear strips of remnant vegetation or also made use of the broader highly modified landscape matrix; (2) the configuration of the linear vegetated strips affected home range shape; and (3) home range area differed between bandicoots living in linear strips and those in larger remnant habitat patches. We found that: (1) 71% of adult males and 33% of adult females used the matrix, but non-dispersing juveniles were entirely confined to the linear strips; males also travelled greater distances into the matrix (away from the vegetated strips) than females; (2) bandicoots had longer home ranges in narrower strips and males had longer home ranges than females; and (3) home range area for both sexes was smaller in linear strips than has been recorded in other studies in larger remnant habitats. Our study highlights the importance of retaining narrow, fragmented and modified vegetation to accommodate threatened biodiversity within human-dominated landscapes, but suggests the surrounding matrix may also offer important resources for adaptable species, such as bandicoots. Supporting off-reserve conservation of biodiversity in novel ecosystems is increasingly pertinent in our rapidly urbanizing world.},

In the wet beech forests of New Zealand, ornithologists survey the density of endemic forest birds in unlogged tracts of forest between two mountain ranges. Among intensive farmland in the Netherlands, landscape ecologists measure the length of hedgerows that connect small farm woods where bird populations have been censused. In the rangelands of Tanzania, wildlife managers document the pathways followed by herds of Wildebeest and Zebra during seasonal migratory movements. Across rural districts of southern Australia, community volunteers drive along country roads to assess and map the quality of remnant strips of roadside vegetation. What do these activities have in common? Is there a common thread among these diverse actions in different countries across several continents? The examples noted above each illustrate a way in which scientists, planners, local communities or concerned individuals are promoting measures to assist the movements of animals or to maintain the continuity of species populations and ecological processes in the face of habitat change. Their efforts are part of a practical response to the global issue of habitat destruction, fragmentation and isolation in human-dominated landscapes.},

   abstract = {Novel ecosystems are increasingly common worldwide, particularly in areas heavily impacted by humans such as urban and peri-urban landscapes. Consequently, interest in their potential contribution to biodiversity conservation is growing, including their ability to sustain populations of threatened species. However, few studies have explored whether novel habitats can support viable populations over time and how they compare to less modified, remnant habitats. We investigated the capacity for novel habitats to support an endangered mammal, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus obesulus: Peramelidae), in a highly-modified landscape near Australia's second largest city, Melbourne. We compared bandicoot abundance and body condition between five novel and two remnant sites, and examined whether novel sites support residency and key demographic processes necessary for bandicoot population persistence. We found that bandicoot abundance was higher at novel than remnant sites, with the highest abundance at the novel site with the most urbanised surroundings. Female body condition was similar between novel and remnant sites. The majority of bandicoots at novel sites were resident, and breeding activity, recruitment of first-year adults, and survival of mature adults were observed at all novel sites. Our results demonstrate the potential significance of novel habitats for conserving threatened species within heavily-modified landscapes, and encourage us not to judge the quality of habitats on their novelty alone. Broadening our appreciation of the potential value of novel ecosystems could increase off-reserve species conservation opportunities, a key priority within the context of the Anthropocene and unprecedented global change and biodiversity loss.},

Giving everyday objects the ability to connect to a data network would have a range of benefits: making it easier for homeowners to configure their lights and switches, reducing the cost and complexity of building construction, assisting with home health care. Many alternative standards currently compete to do just that--a situation reminiscent of the early days of the Internet, when computers and networks came in multiple incompatible types. To eliminate this technological Tower of Babel, the data protocol that is at the heart of the Internet can be adopted to represent information in whatever form it takes: pulsed electrically, flashed optically, clicked acoustically, broadcast electromagnetically or printed mechanically. Using this "Internet-0" encoding, the original idea of linking computer networks into a seamless whole--the "Inter" in "Internet"--can be extended to networks of all types of devices, a concept known as interdevice internetworking. The solution to building a global network out of heterogeneous local networks, called internetworking, was found in two big ideas. The first was packet switching. The second idea was the "end-to-end" principle.},

While the first cause can be considered as a slow process, the growing presence of humans is leading to rapid aging of coasts. The Mediterranean Sea authorities are focusing on the necessity for a systematic and comprehensive approach to the management of littoral areas. In this context, Italy is searching for a promising solution to safeguard coasts but, at the same time, to manage in an intelligent and 'green' way the big amount of tourists. Research communities all over the world indicated the Internet of Things (IoT) as a valid technology to develop solutions in order to try solving or mitigating the coastal erosion problem. IoT-based techniques allow to manage heterogeneous and massive data for real-time monitoring and decision making and can be used for coastal environment and crowd level monitoring.

Thanks to social relationships, all involved devices in the monitoring system (i.e., sensors, cameras, and smartphones) are able to collect and exchange information.

Reducing emissions of particulate matter not only has an instant effect on air quality, but also moderates climate change. By controlling the environmental pollution, the cities are devoid of health issues and other harmful effects. Further by using the technologies of Internet of Things and cloud computing, the measured sensor values are suggested to store in cloud storage and communicated to the authorities.

   abstract = {Tracking of pedestrian behaviour, particularly route selection and temporal behaviours, can be difficult to undertake. This is especially true of studies at a community or campus level where the anonymity of pedestrians can be difficult to protect. The introduction of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations 2016 (GDPR) has increased the complexity of this challenge. Advances in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology in recent years have increased the potential to monitor human behaviour by tracking and triangulating pedestrians. This paper describes an experiment undertaken along The Great South Wall at the Port of Dublin, which is considered a leading amenity location. Monitoring of visitor behaviour in places of this type can provide valuable information about the use of this and other public resources. The aims of this study were to test two prototypes to: i) determine the direction of participants carrying BLE devices, ii) determine the capabilities of two BLE scanning prototypes, (ESP32 \& Raspberry Pi3), iii) test the ability of detecting a small number of BLE devices simultaneously while minimising interference or loss of passers-by data, iv) to investigate the use of a hash encoding scheme to anonymise BLE device identifiers. The findings show that the direction of the visitors to the pier can be detected by correlating the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) from multiple Bluetooth scanning devices and this can work where scanning devices are as close as 10m apart. The locations of the BLE scanners has a slight effect on detecting the RSSI from different distances and the distance between scanners needs to be considered to facilitate accurate measurement of direction. As a pier like the South Wall has only one entrance and exit point, this approach can also be used to determine the length of time spent on the pier. The technical performance of the two BLE scanners was also reviewed and the ESP32 was shown to have significantly lower power consumption with only a slight decrease in performance. Finally, it was shown that the BLE scanners can detect multiple carried BLE devices successfully without interference or loss of data as long as those devices are within range of the BLE scanners.},

The Visual Social Distancing (VSD) offers an opportunity for real-time measuring and analysing the physical distance between pedestrians using surveillance videos in public spaces. It potentially provides new evidence for implementing effective prevention measures of the pandemic. The existing VSD methods developed in the literature are primarily based on frame-by-frame pedestrian detection, addressing the VSD problem from a static and local perspective. In this paper, we propose a new online multi-pedestrian tracking approach for spatio-temporal trajectory and its application to multi-scale social distancing measuring and analysis. Firstly, an online multi-pedestrian tracking method is proposed to obtain the trajectories of pedestrians in public spaces, based on hierarchical data association. Then, a new VSD method based on sptatio-temporal trajectories is proposed. The proposed method not only considers the Euclidean distance between tracking objects frame-by-frame but also takes into account the discrete Fréchet distance between trajectories, hence forms a comprehensive solution from both static and dynamic, local and holistic perspectives. We evaluated the performance of the proposed tracking method using the public dataset MOT16 benchmark. We also collected our own pedestrian dataset “SCU-VSD” and designed a multi-scale VSD analysis scheme for benchmarking the performance of the social distancing monitoring in the crowd. Experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method achieved outstanding performance on the analysis of social distancing.},

   abstract = {Physical distancing, as a measure to contain the spreading of Covid-19, is defining a “new normal”. Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: “in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?”, “Are there repeated offenders?”, and “How are new crowd management measures performing?”. Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.},

   abstract = {Social distancing is a recommended solution by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in public places. The majority of governments and national health authorities have set the 2-m physical distancing as a mandatory safety measure in shopping centres, schools and other covered areas. In this research, we develop a hybrid Computer Vision and YOLOv4-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for automated people detection in the crowd in indoor and outdoor environments using common CCTV security cameras. The proposed DNN model in combination with an adapted inverse perspective mapping (IPM) technique and SORT tracking algorithm leads to a robust people detection and social distancing monitoring. The model has been trained against two most comprehensive datasets by the time of the research—the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) and Google Open Image datasets. The system has been evaluated against the Oxford Town Centre dataset (including 150,000 instances of people detection) with superior performance compared to three state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation has been conducted in challenging conditions, including occlusion, partial visibility, and under lighting variations with the mean average precision of 99.8% and the real-time speed of 24.1 fps. We also provide an online infection risk assessment scheme by statistical analysis of the spatio-temporal data from people’s moving trajectories and the rate of social distancing violations. We identify high-risk zones with the highest possibility of virus spread and infection. This may help authorities to redesign the layout of a public place or to take precaution actions to mitigate high-risk zones. The developed model is a generic and accurate people detection and tracking solution that can be applied in many other fields such as autonomous vehicles, human action recognition, anomaly detection, sports, crowd analysis, or any other research areas where the human detection is in the centre of attention.},

   abstract = {Many observations of the dynamics of pedestrian crowds, including various self-organization phenomena, have been successfully described by simple many-particle models. For ethical reasons, however, there is a serious lack of experimental data regarding crowd panic. Therefore, we have analyzed video recordings of the crowd disaster in Mina/Makkah during the Hajj in 1426H on 12 January 2006. They reveal two subsequent, sudden transitions from laminar to stop-and-go and "turbulent" flows, which question many previous simulation models. While the transition from laminar to stop-and-go flows supports a recent model of bottleneck flows, the subsequent transition to turbulent flow is not yet well understood. It is responsible for sudden eruptions of pressure release comparable to earthquakes, which cause sudden displacements and the falling and trampling of people. The insights of this study into the reasons for critical crowd conditions are important for the organization of safer mass events. In particular, they allow one to understand where and when crowd accidents tend to occur. They have also led to organizational changes, which have ensured a safe Hajj in 1427H. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Pedestrian traffic is an important subject of surveillance to ensure public safety and traffic management, which may benefit from intelligent and continuous analysis of pedestrian videos. State-of-the-art methods for intelligent pedestrian surveillance have a number of limitations in automating and deriving useful information of high-density pedestrian traffic (HDPT) using closed circuit television (CCTV) images. This work introduces an automatic and improved HDPT surveillance system by integrating and optimizing multiple computational steps to predict pedestrian distribution from input video frames. A fast and efficient particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique is proposed to yield pedestrian velocities. A machine learning regressor model, boosted Ferns, is used to improve pedestrian count and density estimation: an essential metric for HDPT analysis. A camera perspective model is proposed to improve the speed and position estimates of HDPT by projecting 2D image pixels to 3D world-coordinate dat. All these functional improvements in HDPT velocity and displacement estimations are used as inputs to a sophisticated pedestrian flow evolution model, PEDFLOW to predict HDPT distribution at a future time point, which is a crucial information for pedestrian traffic management. The predicted and simulated HDPT properties (density, velocity) obtained using the proposed framework show low errors when compared to the ground truth data. The proposed framework is computationally efficient, suitable for multiple camera feeds with HDPT videos, and capable of rapidly analyzing and predicting flows of thousands of pedestrians. The paper shows one of the first steps towards fully integrated CCTV-based automated HDPT management system.},

In this paper, the developed system goes one step further to estimate the number of people in crowded scenes in a complex background by using a single image. Therefore, more valuable information than crowd density can be obtained. There are two major steps in this system: recognition of the head-like contour and estimation of crowd size. First, the Haar wavelet transform (HWT) is used to extract the featured area of the head-like contour, and then the support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify these featured area as the contour of a head or not. Next, the perspective transforming technique of computer vision is used to estimate crowd size more accurately. Finally, a model world is constructed to test this proposed system and the system is also applied for real-world images.},

This estimation is crucial for the problem of crowd monitoring and control. The assessment is carried out on a set of nearly 300 real images captured from Liverpool Street Train Station, London, UK, using texture measures extracted from the images through the following four different methods: gray level dependence matrices, straight line segments, Fourier analysis, and fractal dimensions. The estimations of crowd densities are given in terms of the classification of the input images in five classes of densities (very low, low, moderate, high and very high). Three types of classifiers are used: neural (implemented according to the Kohonen model), Bayesian, and an approach based on fitting functions. The results obtained by these three classifiers, using the four texture measures, allowed the conclusion that, for the problem of crowd density estimation, texture analysis is very effective.},

The role-based tasks of mobile agents include collecting data, analyzing data and sharing data in the campaign. Mobile agents execute and control the campaign autonomously as a multi-agent system and migrate in the opportunistic network of participants’ devices. Mobile agents take into account the available resources in the devices and match participants’ privacy requirements to the campaign requirements. Sharing of task results in real-time facilitates cooperation towards the campaign goal while maintaining a selected global measure, such as energy efficiency. We discuss current challenges in crowdsensing and propose mobile agent based solutions for campaign execution and monitoring, addressing data collection and participant-related issues. We present a software framework for mobile agents-based crowdsensing that is seamlessly integrated into the Web. A set of simulations are conducted to compare mobile agent-based campaigns with existing crowdsensing approaches. We implemented and evaluated a small-scale real-world mobile agent based campaign for pedestrian flock detection. The simulation and evaluation results show that mobile agent based campaigns produce comparable results with less energy consumption when the number of agents is relatively small and enables in-network data processing with sharing of data and task results with insignificant overhead.},

Nonetheless, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the wellbeing benefits associated with urban green and blue spaces from the Global South, where the fastest rates of population growth and urban expansion are occurring. Here, we examine green and blue spaces in Georgetown, Guyana, exploring whether frequency and duration of use is (1) associated with nature-relatedness, safety concerns, and sociodemographic characteristics, (2) associated with specific visit motivations (e.g. physical, cognitive, social), and (3) associated with wellbeing (positive and negative experiential, evaluative, eudaimonic, and mental wellbeing). Participants (n = 512) were more likely to visit green and blue spaces if they had higher nature-relatedness, no safety concerns, aged <35 years, and educated above secondary level. Visit frequency was not related to wellbeing. Visit duration did not differentiate according to visit motivations. Visits to green and blue spaces of more than 25 min were associated with increased positive experiential wellbeing. No comparable patterns were found for the other wellbeing dimensions. These findings can inform public health campaigns targeted at specific sociodemographic groups. Moreover, decision-makers could minimise health inequalities by incorporating new green and blue spaces into future development plans (including the provision of backyards), and enhancing existing spaces (e.g. reducing people's safety concerns). These measures will help maximise wellbeing across all sectors of society.},

These hypotheses were tested using multilevel logistic regressions fitted on samples from the nationally representative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (10–11 years old, n = 3469, and 14–15 years old, n = 2814) and the GINIplus and LISA cohorts (10 years old, n = 1461, and 15 years old, n = 4172) from the Munich, Wesel, and Leipzig areas of Germany. Questionnaire-based binary indicators of sleep sufficiency and sleep quality in each cohort were assessed with respect to objectively measured green space exposures adjusting for age, sex, and maternal education. Models were augmented with proxy measures of traffic noise and two-way interaction terms to test for effect modification. Cross-tabulations illustrated little convincing evidence of association between green space and insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality in either sample, except for insufficient sleep among 10 year old participants in Germany. These null findings were replicated in adjusted models. The proxy for traffic noise was associated with poor quality sleep in 15 year old participants in Germany, but no convincing evidence of modified association with green space was observed.},

An amplifier was placed in front of each tree belt, while a noise meter was placed at various heights and distances behind the tree belt. Net noise reduction effect termed as "relative attenuation" was obtained by subtracting the sound pressure level at each measurement site behind the tree belt from the sound pressure level at equal distances over open ground. Five parameters, including visibility, height, and width of the tree belt, height of receiver and noise source, and the distance between noise source and receiver, were studied. A multiple regression model demonstrating the order of importance of the five parameters in relation to relative attenuation was developed. The five parameters were then transformed into three-dimensionless parameters, i.e., h′: receiver and noise source height/tree height, d′: distance between noise source and receiver/tree height, and m′: belt width/visibility. By plotting the relative attenuation on the coordinate axis of h′, d′ and m′ and curve fitting, a three-dimensionless map of noise reduction by tree belts was formed. The map can be used as guidance in designing three belts for noise reduction in environmental planning. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Opportunistic service composition dynamically transfers control among service providers to bind and execute services in a decentralised way. Unlike existing fragmentation and broker-based designs, it interleaves provider allocation with service execution to counteract mobility in a flexible manner. Early simulation results suggest that this approach reduces the failure probability and communication overhead of complex service requests. This illustrates that opportunistic service composition may be feasible to manage collaboration in dynamic ad hoc environments. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {The vast majority of advances in sensor network research over the last five years have focused on the development of a series of small-scale (100s of nodes) testbeds and specialized applications (e.g., environmental monitoring, etc.) that are built on low-powered sensor devices that self-organize to form application-specific multihop wireless networks. We believe that sensor networks have reached an important crossroads in their development. The question we address in this paper is how to propel sensor networks from their small-scale application-specific network origins, into the commercial mainstream of people's every day lives; the challenge being: how do we develop large-scale general-purpose sensor networks for the general public (e.g., consumers) capable of supporting a wide variety of applications in urban settings (e.g., enterprises, hospitals, recreational areas, towns, cities, and the metropolis). We propose MetroSense, a new people-centric paradigm for urban sensing at the edge of the Internet, at very large scale. We discuss a number of challenges, interactions and characteristics in urban sensing applications, and then present the MetroSense architecture which is based fundamentally on three design principles: network symbiosis, asymmetric design, and localized interaction. The ability of MetroSense to scale to very large areas is based on the use of an opportunistic sensor networking approach. Opportunistic sensor networking leverages mobility-enabled interactions and provides coordination between people-centric mobile sensors, static sensors and edge wireless access nodes in support of opportunistic sensing, opportunistic tasking, and opportunistic data collection. We discuss architectural challenges including providing sensing coverage with sparse mobile sensors, how to hand off roles and responsibilities between sensors, improving network performance and connectivity using adaptive multihop, and importantly, providing security and privacy for people-centric sensors and data. ©2006 ACM.},

   abstract = {Gaining insights into pedestrian flow operations and assessment tools for pedestrian walking speeds and comfort is important in for instance planning and geometric design of infrastructural facilities. Additionally, management of pedestrian flows requires knowledge of pedestrian flow behavior. However, compared to vehicular traffic, pedestrian flow operations are very complex. This is why vehicular flow simulation modeling approaches are generally not applicable to pedestrian flows. Motivated by the need for accurate pedestrian flow models, this report presents an integral theory and models for pedestrian activity scheduling, path determination in the twodimensional space, and walking behavior, under the assumption of utility optimization. In the theory put forward, pedestrians are assumed to make a simultaneous choice of the optimal activity pattern and path, on the one hand optimizing the utility of the activities, while on the other hand minimizing the cost of walking to reach the activity areas. In doing so, we formulate the pedestrian wayfinding problem as an optimal control problem in continuous time and space, where pedestrians aim to walk to the respective activity areas, while optimizing some trade-off between travel time, discomfort due to walking too close to obstacles and walking too quickly. At the same time, both the order in which the activities are performed (as far as their order is free), as well as whether an activity is performed at all, is optimized as well. Given that the pedestrian has determined both the optimal activity pattern as well as the optimal path, we postulate that pedestrian behavior at the operational level is also a result of a utility optimization process. At this level, pedestrians minimize the cost incurred while straying from the planned path, walking too close to other pedestrians, and cost due to large accelerations and decelerations. By applying calculus of variations, explicit mathematical relations are derived describing the acceleration, direction changing, and interaction behavior of a pedestrian. Throughout the report, the theory and models are illustrated by application examples.},

A layered representation is first introduced and a generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to separate infrared images into background (still) and foreground (moving) layers regardless of camera panning. In the two-pass scheme of detecting pedestrians from the foreground layer: shape cue is first used to eliminate non-pedestrian moving objects and then appearance cue helps to locate the exact position of pedestrians. Templates with varying sizes are sequentially applied to detect pedestrians at multiple scales to accommodate different camera distances. To facilitate the task of pedestrian tracking, we formulate the problem of shot segmentation and present a graph matching-based tracking algorithm that jointly exploits the shape, appearance and distance information.

   abstract = {Nighttime driving is more dangerous than daytime driving-particularly for senior drivers. Three to four times as many driving-related deaths occur at night than in the daytime. To improve the safety of night driving, automatic pedestrian detection based on infrared images has drawn increased attention because pedestrians tend to stand out more against the background in infrared images than they do in visible light images. Nevertheless, pedestrian detection in infrared images is by no means trivial-many of the known difficulties carry over from visible light images, such as image variability occasioned by pedestrians being in different poses. Typically, several different pedestrian templates have to be used in order to deal with a range of poses. Furthermore, pedestrian detection is difficult because of poor infrared image quality (low resolution, low contrast, few distinguishable feature points, little texture information, etc.) and misleading signals. To address these problems, this paper introduces a shape-independent pedestrian-detection method. Our segmentation algorithm first estimates pedestrians' horizontal locations through projection-based horizontal segmentation and then determines pedestrians' vertical locations through brightness/bodyline-based vertical segmentation. Our classification method defines multidimensional histogram-, inertia-, and contrast-based classification features. The features are shape-independent, complementary to one another, and capture the statistical similarities of image patches containing pedestrians with different poses. Thus, our pedestrian-detection system needs only one pedestrian template-corresponding to a generic walking pose-and avoids brute-force searching for pedestrians throughout whole images, which typically involves brightness-similarity comparisons between candidate image patches and a multiplicity of pedestrian templates. Our pedestrian-detection system is neither based on tracking nor does it depend on camera calibration to determine the relationship between an object's height and its vertical image locations. Thus, it is less restricted in applicability. Even if much work is still needed to bridge the gap between present pedestrian-detection performance and the high reliability required for real-world applications, our pedestrian-detection system is straightforward and provides encouraging results in improving speed, reliability, and simplicity. © 2004 IEEE.},

The authors reserved a dedicated section for the analysis of the Deep Learning methodologies, including the Convolutional Neural Networks in pedestrian detection and tracking, considering their recent exploding adoption for such a kind systems. Finally, focusing on the classification point of view, different Machine Learning techniques have been analysed, basing the discussion on the classification performances on different benchmark datasets.

Furthermore, the proposed schemes can be employed for the detection of several diverse traffic objects of interest (vehicles, bicycles, etc.) The system outputs the spatio-temporal coordinates of each pedestrian during the period the pedestrian is in the scene. Processing is done at three levels: raw images, blobs, and pedestrians. Blob tracking is modeled as a graph optimization problem. Pedestrians are modeled as rectangular patches with a certain dynamic behavior. Kalman filtering is used to estimate pedestrian parameters. The system was implemented on a Datacube MaxVideo 20 equipped with a Datacube Max860 and was able to achieve a peak performance of over 30 frames per second.

   abstract = {Optimal escape theory predicts that animals should moderate their flight responses according to the level of risk represented by a potential predator. This theory should apply even when organisms are habituated to disturbance, and how animals respond to human presence is likely to determine their success exploiting urban habitats. Therefore, urban animals should be sensitive to cues that inform them about levels of risk, allowing them to reduce costs by not overreacting to innocuous stimuli, while ensuring that they are nevertheless reactive to genuinely threatening stimuli. We tested this at a highly urbanized site in New York City, where eastern grey squirrels appear to pay little attention to humans. Squirrels were approached tangentially on a trajectory that took the observer within ∼2m of them and we measured alert distance, flight initiation distance (FID), and distance fled for each focal individual. Squirrels showed little sign of being alerted to the pedestrian if he remained on the footpath and did not look at them (only 5% of individuals moved away), but 90% of squirrels moved away, with longer FID and flight distance, when approached by a pedestrian that moved off the footpaths and looked at them. Squirrels therefore modulate their reactions when pedestrians behave in a predictable manner (i.e. remaining on the footpaths) and are also sensitive to the direction of attention of humans, reducing unnecessary responses, and are thereby likely to be increasing their ability to persist in this urban environment. Previous studies have emphasized the behavioural plasticity of successful urban wildlife species. In this study, we emphasize the importance of disturbance monitoring by successful urban exploiters, allowing them to vary their behavioural responses according to the level of risk to which they are exposed.},

   abstract = {Urban sidewalks are of primary importance in a city environment, allowing for pedestrian flow distribution, and making up for an essential component of every city. Yet, pedestrian sidewalks have to live together with other transportation channels, like streets, and the result is that they tend to be seen as secondary with respect to traffic in most parts of the cities. The result of this policy is that the detection of their actual status, and corresponding maintenance, is often far from optimal. In this study we tackle the problem of monitoring pedestrian sidewalks, in order to promptly and effectively handle their maintenance. Following the Smart Cheap City (SCC) approach, we design and implement a system of sensors that allows to gather pedestrian data by staying within a very limited budget. We then show how this raw data can be turned into valuable information about the actual pedestrian flows, and then investigate the relationship between this flow information and the problem of sidewalks monitoring. We experiment with the system in a real city context, using various configurations, and show the effectiveness of the method when used on the field. The overall lesson is that the problem of sidewalks monitoring, and related maintenance, can be faced even when employing very limited resources, therefore allowing for a better handling of these transportation channels even when dealing with large urban areas.},

   abstract = {If conservation priority birds are to persist in an increasingly anthropogenically altered world, suitable habitat must be created or preserved in potentially unsuitable landscapes. While natural areas in urban environments may provide habitat for declining groups of birds, little is known about effects of urbanization on the reproductive success of birds, such as grassland birds, that are typically thought to be associated with more rural landscapes. While typical conservation efforts have focused on conserving large patches of grassland in landscapes containing minimal amounts of woody vegetation and development, the assumption that habitat located in developed landscapes is of poor quality has not been tested and may wrongly devalue grasslands located in an urban matrix. To examine the influence of development on habitat quality for grassland birds, we studied grassland bird nest predation and brood parasitism in patches of varying size along an urbanization gradient in northeastern Illinois. Because nest predation is the primary cause of reproductive failure and a potentially limiting factor for grassland bird populations, we used miniature video cameras to identify predators at a subset of nests. From 2012 to 2013, we monitored 432 nests of 16 grassland bird species. Nest predation rates decreased with urbanization in the landscape as did probability of brood parasitism. We filmed 44 nests and documented 19 predation events. We found that coyotes Canis latrans, white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus and thirteen-lined ground squirrels Ictidomys tridecemlineatus were important nest predators in our study system. Contrary to prior assumptions, our results suggest that grasslands located in urban landscapes may provide habitat of equal or greater quality than many rural grasslands.},

   abstract = {Animal movement can be significantly altered in human-dominated landscapes such as urban and peri-urban areas, where habitat is often fragmented and/or linear. Knowledge regarding how wildlife respond to anthropogenic change is vital for informing conservation efforts in such landscapes, including the design of nature reserves and wildlife corridors. To better understand how threatened species persist and behave within human-dominated landscapes, we examined the home range and space use of the nationally endangered southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus obesulus in peri-urban Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city. Specifically, we examined whether: (1) bandicoots were confined to linear strips of remnant vegetation or also made use of the broader highly modified landscape matrix; (2) the configuration of the linear vegetated strips affected home range shape; and (3) home range area differed between bandicoots living in linear strips and those in larger remnant habitat patches. We found that: (1) 71% of adult males and 33% of adult females used the matrix, but non-dispersing juveniles were entirely confined to the linear strips; males also travelled greater distances into the matrix (away from the vegetated strips) than females; (2) bandicoots had longer home ranges in narrower strips and males had longer home ranges than females; and (3) home range area for both sexes was smaller in linear strips than has been recorded in other studies in larger remnant habitats. Our study highlights the importance of retaining narrow, fragmented and modified vegetation to accommodate threatened biodiversity within human-dominated landscapes, but suggests the surrounding matrix may also offer important resources for adaptable species, such as bandicoots. Supporting off-reserve conservation of biodiversity in novel ecosystems is increasingly pertinent in our rapidly urbanizing world.},

   abstract = {Understanding how fundamental aspects of species’ ecology, such as diet, are affected in human-dominated landscapes is vital for informing management and conserving biodiversity – particularly where species influence important ecosystem functions. Digging, mycophagous (‘fungus-eating’) mammals play various such roles, including the dispersal of hypogeal (‘truffle-like’) fungi. The endangered, mycophagous southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus obesulus: Peramelidae) persists in a peri-urban landscape south-east of Melbourne, Australia, where it occupies both ‘novel’ habitats (linear strips of vegetation along roadsides, drains and railway lines) and ‘remnant’ habitats (larger blocks of native vegetation) within dedicated conservation areas. It remains unknown how bandicoot diet, including the diversity of hypogeal fungi, varies between these habitat types, yet this could have important conservation implications. Our study aimed to (i) compare the diet of I. o. obesulus at novel and remnant sites; and (ii) attain knowledge of hypogeal fungal diversity in these different contexts. We collected 133 bandicoot scats over 23 months and examined both broad diet composition and diversity of fungi consumed. Bandicoot diet differed between site types; in particular, ants were more prominent in scats from remnant sites, while millipedes and seeds were more prominent in scats from novel sites. All scats contained fungal spores, with hypogeal taxa comprising at least 35 of the 78 ‘morphotypes’ found at novel sites and 28 of the 59 detected at remnant sites. Fewer samples were collected at remnant sites, but they appeared to contain a greater richness of hypogeal fungi per scat. We did not detect any differences in fungal composition between site types. However, our sampling effort was insufficient to estimate true morphotype richness at either site type. Our study highlights the adaptable generalist diet of the southern brown bandicoot, as well as the likely under-appreciated diversity of hypogeal fungi that can occur in highly modified, novel ecosystems.},

   abstract = {The influence of predators on bird populations is controversial and poorly understood, especially in urban areas where predator densities can be particularly high. We assessed if fine-scale spatial variation in predator activity and proximity have direct and indirect effects on urban songbird distributions and breeding success, by testing the hypotheses that (1) songbirds that are sensitive to nest predation select territories with reduced activity of nest predators; (2) blackbird Turdus merula, a species that experiences high nest predation rates, lays smaller clutches in territories located in areas with higher numbers of nest predators as predicted by Skutch's hypothesis; (3) songbirds that are sensitive to nest predation have higher nest predation rates in areas with greater predator activity. We tested these hypotheses using two sites in urban Sheffield, UK, and focus on nest predatory corvids and grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis. We found no evidence that songbirds that are most sensitive to nest predation adjust their territory location in response to fine-scale spatial variation in predator distributions. It thus seems unlikely that urban predators are indirectly regulating urban bird population size by restricting habitat availability. Blackbirds did not vary their clutch size in response to predator distributions. These findings generate the potential for an ecological trap in which prey species fail to avoid areas with the highest concentrations of nest predators, or to exhibit behavioural adjustments to reduce the risk of nest predation at such sites. We find some evidence for such ecological traps as, while fine-scale variation in grey squirrel occurrence and activity were not associated with nest predation rates, nests located in closer proximity to corvids and in areas with higher indices of corvid activity experienced slightly higher nest predation rates.},

Nevertheless, a few species appear to thrive in the evolutionarily novel environment created by cities, demonstrating the remarkable adaptability of some animals. We argue that individuals that can adjust their behaviours to the new selection pressures presented by cities should have greater success in urban habitats. Accordingly, urban wildlife often exhibit behaviours that differ from those of their rural counterparts, from changes to food and den preferences to adjustments in the structure of their signals. Research suggests that behavioural flexibility (or phenotypic plasticity) may be an important characteristic for succeeding in urban environments. Moreover, some individuals or species might possess behavioural traits (a particular temperament) that are inherently well suited to occupying urban habitats, such as a high level of disturbance tolerance. This suggests that members of species that are less 'plastic' or naturally timid in temperament are likely to be disadvantaged in high-disturbance environments and consequently may be precluded from colonizing cities and towns. © 2012 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

   abstract = {Cities may represent one of the most challenging environments for carnivorous mammals. For example, cities have a dearth of vegetation and other natural resources, coupled with increased habitat fragmentation and an abundance of roads as well as altered climate (e.g. temperature, light, rainfall and water runoff). It is therefore intriguing that several carnivore species have become established in cities across the globe. Medium-sized carnivores such as the red fox, coyote, Eurasian badger and raccoon not only survive in cities but also have managed to exploit anthropogenic food sources and shelter to their significant advantage, achieving higher population densities than are found under natural conditions. In addition, although they may not live permanently within cities, even large carnivores such as bears, wolves and hyaenas derive significant benefit from living adjacent to urbanized areas. In this review, we examine the history of urban adaptation by mammalian carnivores, explore where they are living, what they eat, what kills them and the behavioural consequences of living in urban areas. We review the biology of urban carnivores, exploring traits such as body size and dietary flexibility. Finally, we consider the consequences of having populations of carnivores in urbanized areas, both for humans and for these charismatic mammals. In conclusion, in a time of massive environmental change across the globe, the continuing encroachment of urbanization upon wilderness areas is substantially reducing the availability of natural habitats for many species; therefore, understanding the biology of any taxon that is able to adapt to and exploit anthropogenically disturbed systems must aid us in both controlling and developing suitable conservation measures for the future of such species. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.},

   abstract = {The initial response of individuals to human-induced environmental change is often behavioural. This can improve the performance of individuals under sudden, large-scale perturbations and maintain viable populations. The response can also give additional time for genetic changes to arise and, hence, facilitate adaptation to new conditions. On the other hand, maladaptive responses, which reduce individual fitness, may occur when individuals encounter conditions that the population has not experienced during its evolutionary history, which can decrease population viability. A growing number of studies find human disturbances to induce behavioural responses, both directly and by altering factors that influence fitness. Common causes of behavioural responses are changes in the transmission of information, the concentration of endocrine disrupters, the availability of resources, the possibility of dispersal, and the abundance of interacting species. Frequent responses are alterations in habitat choice, movements, foraging, social behaviour and reproductive behaviour. Behavioural responses depend on the genetically determined reaction norm of the individuals, which evolves over generations. Populations first respond with individual behavioural plasticity, whereafter changes may arise through innovations and the social transmission of behavioural patterns within and across generations, and, finally, by evolution of the behavioural response over generations. Only a restricted number of species show behavioural adaptations that make them thrive in severely disturbed environments. Hence, rapid human-induced disturbances often decrease the diversity of native species, while facilitating the spread of invasive species with highly plastic behaviours. Consequently, behavioural responses to human-induced environmental change can have profound effects on the distribution, adaptation, speciation and extinction of populations and, hence, on biodiversity. A better understanding of the mechanisms of behavioural responses and their causes and consequences could improve our ability to predict the effects of human-induced environmental change on individual species and on biodiversity. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {Urban green spaces (GS) are essential for the well-being of the population. Several works have shown a positive correlation between the amount of GS and the household incomes in both developed and developing countries. Thus, the higher the incomes, the larger the total area covered by GS, the better the quality of these spaces, the higher the amount of private GS. Public policies seek to correct this inequality, but existing indicators, especially the amount of GS per inhabitant, do not provide enough information for effective decision-making. Our aim was to provide tools to evaluate and plan better the location and quality of GS in complex urban areas. For this we applied a set of indicators for GS at two spatial scales city-level and local-level, in order to disclose existing inequalities. The indicators considered (i) the total area of GS in relation to population and urban context, (ii) the quality of GS based on its size, shape and vegetation cover, and (iii) the spatial distribution and accessibility of GS. The proposed indicators were tested in three municipalities, belonging to the Metropolitan Area of Santiago (Chile), with different household incomes. The indicators showed large differences in terms of quantity of GS per inhabitant, vegetation cover and accessibility. The GS proved to be an effective strategy to reduce areas that lack vegetation cover. The sustainability assessments must consider how the diversity of structural attributes of GS has an impact on the well-being of urban inhabitants.},

Our results show that all urban mammals produce larger litters; whereas other traits such as body size, behavioural plasticity and diet diversity were important for some but not all taxonomic groups. This variation highlights the idiosyncrasies of the urban adaptation process and likely reflects the diversity of ecological niches and roles mammals can play.

   abstract = {The paper proposes a novel approach for direction estimation of a moving pedestrian as perceived in a 2-D coordinate of field camera. The proposed direction estimation method is intended for pedestrian monitoring in traffic control systems. Apart from traffic control, direction of motion estimation is also very important in accident avoidance system for smart cars, assisted living systems, in occlusion prediction for seamless tracking in visual surveillance, and so on. The proposed video-based direction estimation method exploits the notion of perspective distortion as perceived in monocular vision of 2-D camera co-ordinate. The temporal pattern of change in dimension of pedestrian in a frame sequence is unique for each direction; hence, the dimensional change-based feature is used to estimate the direction of motion; eight discrete directions of motion are considered and the hidden Markov model is used for classification. The experiments are conducted over CASIA Dataset A, CASIA Dataset B, and over a self-acquired dataset: NITR Conscious Walk Dataset. The balanced accuracy of direction estimation for these experiments yields satisfactory results with accuracy indices as 94.58%, 90.87%, and 95.83%, respectively. The experiment also justifies with suitable test conditions about the characteristic features, such as robustness toward improper segmentation, partial occlusion, and changing orientation of head or body during walk of a pedestrian. The proposed method can be used as a standalone system or can be integrated with existing frame-based direction estimation methods for implementing a pedestrian monitoring system.},

While BLE was not designed specifically with vehicular communications in mind, its simple and quick connection establishment mechanisms make BLE a potential inter-vehicle communication technology, either replacing or complementing other vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technologies (such as the yet to be deployed DSRC). In this paper we propose a framework for V2V communication using BLE and evaluate its performance under various configurations. BLE uses two major methods for data transmission: (1) undirected advertisements and scanning (unconnected mode) and (2) using the central and peripheral modes of the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) connection (connected mode). This paper investigates quantitative and qualitative advantages and disadvantages of both approaches and proposes a communication framework based on the central/peripheral mode, which uses a random role switching technique to ensure frequent communication opportunities between devices. Further, experiments on BLE-equipped Android devices are used to study the impacts of different framework parameters on communication performance, loss rates, and scalability. The paper further discusses other limitations, prospects, and potential applications of a BLE-based communication framework for VANETs.},

Specifically, we show how these applications share the sensors and actuators in the house. In the future, we will integrate them through an award winning project called Orchid House.},

   abstract = {Appliance load monitoring in smart homes has been gaining importance due to its significant advantages in achieving an energy efficient smart grid. The methods to manage such processes can be classified into hardware-based methods, including intrusive load monitoring (ILM) and software-based methods referring to non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). ILM is based on low-end meter devices attached to home appliances in opposition to NILM techniques, where only a single point of sensing is needed. Although ILM solutions can be relatively expensive, they provide higher efficiency and reliability than NILMs. Moreover, future solutions are expected to be hybrid, combining the benefits of NILM along with individual power measurement by smart plugs and smart appliances. This paper proposes a novel ILM approach for load monitoring that aims to develop an activity recognition system based on IoT architecture. The proposed IoT architecture consists of the appliances layer, perception layer, communication network layer, middleware layer, and application layer. The main function of the appliance recognition module is to label sensor data and allow the implementation of different home applications. Three different classifier models are tested using real data from the UK-DALE dataset: feed-forward neural network (FFNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and support vector machine (SVM). The developed activities of daily living (ADL) algorithm maps each ADL to a set of criteria depending on the appliance used. The features are extracted according to the consumption in Watt-hours and the times where they are switched on. In the FFNN and the LSTM networks, the accuracy is above 0.9 while around 0.8 for the SVM network. Other experiments are performed to evaluate the classifier model using a new test set. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to study the impact of the group size on the classifier accuracy.},

In this paper, we first investigate the integration of smart home and botanical IoT for creating a better living environment to increase people’s quality of life. First, we point out that traditional smart home solution (Smart Home 1.0) only achieves the interaction between users and home appliances in indoor environment, while ignoring the relation between users and indoor greeneries. Then, we discuss the benefits of indoor greeneries for improving indoor living environment which leads a better physical health and mental health for home users. As greeneries are integrated into Smart Home 1.0, we propose an evolution from traditional smart home solution to Smart Home 2.0 to achieve the organic integration between users and greeneries. To verify our proposal, a prototype system of Smart Home 2.0 is designed and implemented. The experimental results show the smooth data flows from sensors deployed in smart green house to data center. A mobile cloud system is built to store, manage and visualize the data for the affective interaction between greeneries and home users. It is foreseeable that the emotion-aware capability of smart home 2.0 will bring more intelligent and interactive healthcare applications for urban residents in the future.},

In fact, monitoring and control applications, energy harvesting, and innovative metering methodologies through smart wireless devices are becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel energy management approach for smart homes that combines a wireless network, based on bluetooth low energy (BLE), for communication among home appliances, with a home energy management (HEM) scheme. The proposed approach addresses the impact of standby appliances and high-power rating loads in peak hours to the energy consumption charges of consumers. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is efficient in terms of reducing peak load demand and electricity consumption charges with an increase in the comfort level of consumers.},

This sensor includes three sensing/communication modules: pyroelectric infrared (PIR) occupancy, ultrasound array, and bluetooth low energy (BLE) communication modules. The PIR occupancy module is used to detect the moving direction, while the ultrasound array module detects the moving residents' height. The combination of these two sensing technologies can be used to then detect the moving velocity. The BLE advertising mode is then used to communicate these data to the data server. A new embedded algorithm increased the energy efficiency of this identification technology. A comprehensive modeling and experiments are done to assess the performance of this sensor and the results are provided.},

Traditional systems only support such requirements in stationary applications where a constant power supply is available. Trends toward remote healthcare and telemedicine require wearable devices, able to provide similar functionalities in wireless mode. Miniaturized and thin form factors, desirable in wearable applications, set stringent constraints on the available power, and consequently on the accuracy and lifetime. Energy harvesting combined with low-power design and energy efficient processing can significantly extend the lifetime of wearable devices. This paper presents a wearable pulse oximeter assembled in a 3D ring-like geometry that achieves self-sustainability by exploiting efficient power management, solar energy harvesting, and ultra-low power processing in a multi-core microcontroller. The design strategy of combining onboard processing to monitor blood oxygenation and the transmission of only relevant information via a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) interface, significantly reduces the overall energy consumption. Experimental results on the designed and developed prototype demonstrate that measuring the blood oxygenation once every minute with a sampling rate of 100 samples/s achieve accurate results at the daily energy consumption of 28 J including hourly BLE transmissions. The low-power design allows the system to be self-sustainable with just 64 min of sunlight per day or 12 hrs. of indoor home light.},

An innovative three-dimensional hardware, based on the multi-physical-layer approach is introduced. Using board-to-board connectors, several physical hardware layers are stacked on top of each other.

With this trend, new fields such as industrial IoT have arisen, which in turn have opened the doors to new possibilities that are shaping the future of industrial automation. In contrast to regular wireless networks, however, industrial applications of WSN are characterized for being time-critical systems with highly stringent requirements that challenge all available technologies. Because of its ultra-low energy properties, compatibility with most mobile units, reduced production costs, robustness and high throughput, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a potential candidate for these settings. This article explores the potential of BLE of meeting the real-time demands found in the domain of industrial process automation and industrial IoT. In order to evaluate the suitability of the protocol for these scenarios, the effect of adaptations in the retransmission scheme on the reliability and timeliness performance are thoroughly studied. Three retransmission schemes are evaluated and simulation results proved that by optimally modifying the BLE retransmission model, a maximum delay below 46 ms and a packet loss rate in the order of 10 - 5 can be obtained, enabling BLE to fulfill the requirements of even the most demanding cases within the considered range of applications.},

Minimizing the discovery latency and maximizing the number of devices that can be discovered in a limited time are challenging issues due to collisions between frames sent by advertisers and scanners. The mechanism for resolution of collisions between scanners has a great impact on the achieved performance, but backoff in NDP has been poorly studied so far. This paper includes a detailed analysis of backoff in NDP, identifies and studies the factors involved in the process, reveals the limitations and problems presented by the algorithm suggested by the specifications and proposes simple and practical adaptations on scanner functionality.

Signals of opportunity are commonly used in positioning, whereas the installation of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) sensors on lampposts can provide an opportunity for positioning and heading estimation in urban canyons.

In several field experiments, with improvements in availability and robustness, the heading accuracy of the proposed fusion approach could reach approximately 3 degrees; the positioning accuracy achieved between 2.7 m and 4.2 m, compared with a 30 m error from the GNSS alone. Simultaneously, this system could achieve a high positioning accuracy of 2.4 m with unconstrained smartphones in a mixed environment.

In a 168-m2 testbed, 12 beacons configured to broadcast with the Eddystone and iBeacon protocols were deployed and 40 distance/similarity measures were considered. According to our results, in a specific orientation there is a group of distance metrics coupled with a protocol-channel combination that produces similar accuracy results. Therefore, choosing the right distance metric in that specific orientation is not as critical as choosing the right protocol and, especially, the right channel. There is a trend whereby the protocol-channel combination that provides the best accuracy is almost unique for each orientation.

The proposed algorithm uses FP and PRM to estimate the target’s location and the distances between the target and BLE beacons respectively. We compare the performance of distance estimation that uses separate PRM for three advertisement channels (i.e., the separate strategy) with that use an aggregate PRM generated through the combination of information from all channels (i.e., the aggregate strategy). The performance of FP-based location estimation results of the separate strategy and the aggregate strategy are also compared. It was found that the separate strategy can provide higher accuracy; thus, it is preferred to adopt PRM and FP for each BLE advertisement channel separately. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of the algorithm, a two-level outlier detection mechanism is designed. Distance and location estimates obtained from PRM and FP are passed to the first outlier detection to generate improved distance estimates for the EKF. After the EKF process, the second outlier detection algorithm based on statistical testing is further performed to remove the outliers. The proposed algorithm was evaluated by various field experiments. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieved the accuracy of \&lt;2.56 m at 90% of the time with dense deployment of BLE beacons (1 beacon per 9 m), which performs 35.82% better than \&lt;3.99 m from the Propagation Model (PM) + EKF algorithm and 15.77% more accurate than \&lt;3.04 m from the FP + EKF algorithm. With sparse deployment (1 beacon per 18 m), the proposed algorithm achieves the accuracies of \&lt;3.88 m at 90% of the time, which performs 49.58% more accurate than \&lt;8.00 m from the PM + EKF algorithm and 21.41% better than \&lt;4.94 m from the FP + EKF algorithm. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is especially useful to improve the localization accuracy in environments with sparse beacon deployment.},

Least square algorithms are the powerful tools for linear and nonlinear parameters estimation. Various linear and nonlinear least square methods and their theoretical basics and application performance for indoor positioning have been studied. Simulation and hardware experiments results prove that nonlinear least square method is suitable for parameters estimation of Bluetooth signal propagation, and generalized least square method has better performance than total least square methods.

   abstract = {The positioning methods based on received signal strength (RSS) measurements, link the RSS values to the position of the mobile station (MS) to be located. Their accuracy depends on the suitability of the propagation models used for the actual propagation conditions. In indoor wireless networks, these propagation conditions are very difficult to predict due to the unwieldy and dynamic nature of the RSS. In this paper, we present a novel method which dynamically estimates the propagation models that best fit the propagation environments, by using only RSS measurements obtained in real time. This method is based on maximizing compatibility of the MS to access points (AP) distance estimates. Once the propagation models are estimated in real time, it is possible to accurately determine the distance between the MS and each AP. By means of these distance estimates, the location of the MS can be obtained by trilateration. The method proposed coupled with simulations and measurements in a real indoor environment, demonstrates its feasibility and suitability, since it outperforms conventional RSS-based indoor location methods without using any radio map information nor a calibration stage. © 2010 IEEE.},

To estimate channel model parameters, least mean squares method (LMS) is associated with the trilateration method. In the context of applications where the positions are constrained on a grid, a novel tracking strategy is proposed to determine the real position and obtain the actual parameters in the monitored region. Based on practical data acquired from a real localization system, an experimental channel model is constructed to provide RSSI values and verify the proposed tracking strategy. Quantitative criteria are given to guarantee the efficiency of the proposed tracking strategy by providing a trade-off between the grid resolution and parameter variation. The simulation results show a good behavior of the proposed tracking strategy in the presence of space-time variation of the propagation channel. Compared with the existing RSSI-based algorithms, the proposed tracking strategy exhibits better localization accuracy but consumes more calculation time. In addition, a tracking test is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking strategy.},

To date, there is not adequate feature extraction method that can significantly mitigate the influence of the receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI) variation that degrades the performance of the ANN-based indoor fingerprinting algorithm. In this work, a wavelet scattering transform is used to extract reliable features that are stable to small deformation and rotation invariant.

   abstract = {Localization is one of the current challenges in indoor navigation research. The conventional global positioning system (GPS) is affected by weak signal strengths due to high levels of signal interference and fading in indoor environments. Therefore, new positioning solutions tailored for indoor environments need to be developed. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for indoor localization. However, the performance of a deep learning system depends on the quality of the feature representation. This paper introduces two novel feature set extractions based on the continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) of the received signal strength indicators’ (RSSI) data. The two novel CWT feature sets were augmented with additive white Gaussian noise. The first feature set is CWT image-based, and the second is composed of the CWT PSD numerical data that were dimensionally equalized using principal component analysis (PCA). These proposed image and numerical data feature sets were both evaluated using CNN and ANN models with the goal of identifying the room that the human subject was in and estimating the precise location of the human subject in that particular room. Extensive experiments were conducted to generate the proposed augmented CWT feature set and numerical CWT PSD feature set using two analyzing functions, namely, Morlet and Morse. For validation purposes, the performance of the two proposed feature sets were compared with each other and other existing feature set formulations. The accuracy, precision and recall results show that the proposed feature sets performed better than the conventional feature sets used to validate the study. Similarly, the mean localization error generated by the proposed feature set predictions was less than those of the conventional feature sets used in indoor localization. More particularly, the proposed augmented CWT-image feature set outperformed the augmented CWT-PSD numerical feature set. The results also show that the Morse-based feature sets trained with CNN produced the best indoor positioning results compared to all Morlet and ANN-based feature set formulations.},

   abstract = {As the demand for location services increases, research on location technology has aroused great interest. In particular, signal-based fingerprint location positioning technology has become a research hotspot owing to its high positioning performance. In general, the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) will be used as a location feature to build a fingerprint database. However, at different locations, this feature distinction may not be obvious, resulting in low positioning accuracy. Considering the wavelet transform can get valuable features from the signals, the long-term evolution (LTE) signals were converted into wavelet feature images to construct the fingerprint database. To fully extract the signal features, a two-level hierarchical structure positioning system is proposed to achieve satisfactory positioning accuracy. A deep residual network (ResNet) rough locator is used to learn useful features from the wavelet feature fingerprint image database. Then, inspired by the transfer learning idea, a fine locator based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) is leveraged to further learn the features of the wavelet fingerprint image to obtain better localization performance. Additionally, multiple data enhancement techniques were adopted to increase the richness of the fingerprint dataset, thereby enhancing the robustness of the positioning system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system leads to improved positioning performance in outdoor environments.},

Dealing with mobility can pose some formidable challenges in protocol design, particularly, at the link and network layers. These difficulties require mobility adaption algorithms to efficiently localize mobile nodes and predict the quality of link that can be established with these nodes. An off the shelf development platform that uses Radio Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) is mostly selected as the sensor localization method, especially in the indoor environment. Despite this, not much research work has been done to practically demonstrate the reliability of RSSI for indoor localization. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to calibrate and map RSSI to distance by doing a series of experiments. The result shows that the RSSI technology gives an unacceptable high error and thus is not reliable for the indoor sensor localization.},

The MAC ID location data collected during a three-month monitoring period were mapped using the fingerprinting wireless location sensing method to display the congestion situation in real time. Furthermore we developed a model that can inform immediate response to identified conditions. In addition, we formulated several schemes for disbursing congestion and improving pedestrian flow using behavioral economics, and then confirmed their effectiveness in a follow-up monitoring period.

The proposed direction estimation method is intended for pedestrian monitoring in traffic control systems. Apart from traffic control, direction of motion estimation is also very important in accident avoidance system for smart cars, assisted living systems, in occlusion prediction for seamless tracking in visual surveillance, and so on. The proposed video-based direction estimation method exploits the notion of perspective distortion as perceived in monocular vision of 2-D camera co-ordinate. The temporal pattern of change in dimension of pedestrian in a frame sequence is unique for each direction; hence, the dimensional change-based feature is used to estimate the direction of motion; eight discrete directions of motion are considered and the hidden Markov model is used for classification. The experiments are conducted over CASIA Dataset A, CASIA Dataset B, and over a self-acquired dataset: NITR Conscious Walk Dataset. The balanced accuracy of direction estimation for these experiments yields satisfactory results with accuracy indices as 94.58%, 90.87%, and 95.83%, respectively. The experiment also justifies with suitable test conditions about the characteristic features, such as robustness toward improper segmentation, partial occlusion, and changing orientation of head or body during walk of a pedestrian. The proposed method can be used as a standalone system or can be integrated with existing frame-based direction estimation methods for implementing a pedestrian monitoring system.},

   abstract = {Pedestrian-vehicle conflicts are considered one of the most common safety problems at signalized intersections. In Japan, the pedestrian flashing green (PFG) is considered a safe time interval for pedestrians at crosswalks to finish crossing before conflicting vehicle streams are released. In most common phasing schemes, pedestrians have the right-of-way along with left-turning vehicles (in left-hand traffic). By law, pedestrians should not enter a crosswalk during the PFG. However, many of them rush into crosswalks without necessarily heeding approaching turning vehicles, which could increase the probability of severe conflicts. The objective of this paper is to analyze and model the probabilistic behavior of pedestrians after the onset of the PFG, which contains the pedestrians' decision of whether to give up crossing, as well as the pedestrian speed distribution. Empirical data analysis showed that longer crosswalks lead to significantly higher pedestrian stop probabilities. Furthermore, there is a significant difference between the pedestrians' speeds in the first and second halves of crosswalks. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation showed that the estimated models closely represent the overall stochastic behavior of the pedestrians from the onset of the PFG until the completion of crossing.},

These smart objects are starting to be internet-enabled devices, reaching the so denominated Internet of Things (IoT). Our research work is focused on analyze the capabilities of these technologies for continuous data transmission and integration of clinical sensors in home-care and Ambient Assisted Living environments. For this purpose, this work analyses exhaustively the capabilities from BLE and compare this with the capabilities from Bluetooth 2.1. In addition, it has been considered the communications requirements from different clinical devices such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a capnograph. It is concluded that the performance from BLE is lower than Bluetooth Classic (Bluetooth 2.1) for continuous communications, since BLE is based on attributes (datapoints) transfer instead of offering a communication session where can be transmitted as much packets as required, without any size constraint. Therefore, it is necessary to perform data compression/aggregation when the amount of data to send is too large to be stored in a BLE attribute. This work also presents how to apply pre-processing techniques that greatly reduces the transmission overload (performs signal compression) in order to allow the continuous transmission of the ECG and capnograph signal through BLE making so feasible the integration of continuous clinical devices via BLE.},

   abstract = {Urban designers, ecologists, and social scientists have called for closer links among their disciplines. We examine a promising new tool for promoting this linkage - the metaphor of "cities of resilience." To put this tool to best use, we indicate how metaphor fits with other conceptual tools in science. We then present the two opposing definitions of resilience from ecology, and give reasons why one is more appropriate for linking with design. Additional specific tools and insights that are emerging from, or being increasingly used in, ecology can further support the linkage with urban design. These include recognizing the role of spatial heterogeneity in both ecological and social functioning of urban areas, the integrating power of watersheds, social and ecological patch dynamics of cities, the utility of spatial mosaic models to capture function, the use of an integrated "human ecosystem" modeling framework, and the consequent perspective of metropolitan areas as integrated ecological-social systems. Three additional tools are related to the adaptability of people and human institutions. First is the recognition of a "learning loop" in metropolitan ecosystems in which people respond to and affect ecological change, the use of urban design as experiments whose ecological and social outcomes can be measured, and finally the potency of a dialog between professionals and citizens, communities, and institutions, to support both research and design. The metaphor of resilience, and its technical specifications, draw these diverse strands for linking ecology and planning together. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Although old people make up an extremely vulnerable road-user group, older pedestrians' difficulties have been studied less extensively than those of older drivers, and more knowledge of this issue is still required. The present paper reviews current knowledge of older-adult problems with the main components of pedestrian activity, i.e., walking and obstacle negotiation, wayfinding, and road crossing. Compared to younger ones, old pedestrians exhibit declining walking skills, with a walking speed decrease, less stable balance, less efficient wayfinding strategies, and a greater number of unsafe road crossing behaviors. These difficulties are linked to age-related changes in sensorial, cognitive, physical , and self-perception abilities. It is now known that visual impairment, physical frailty, and attention deficits have a major negative impact on older pedestrians' safety and mobility, whereas the roles of self-evaluation and self-regulation are still poorly understood. All these elements must be taken into consideration , not only in developing effective safety interventions targeting older pedestrians, but also in designing roads and cars. Recent initiatives are presented here and some recommendations are proposed.},

   abstract = {Design in Familiar Places incorporates the findings of Brower's fifteen years of field studies in several Balti-more urban neighborhoods to demonstrate the importance residents' perceptions and behavioral tendencies can have on design and redevelopment of urban residential environments. Brower's primary aim is to make planners and designers aware of what he has learned about how residents see their familiar world of home in fundamentally different ways from designers and what this means to successful physical planning. To do so, he weaves a skillful story of applied research, literature review and his own thinking leading to the conclusion that \&dquo;to create good housing we must create places that people care about and that satisfy their need for familiar surroundings\&dquo; (p. xv). The author, a former practitioner turned academic, has an obviously rich storehouse of experience and observations from which he draws. Most of his studies were done for the Baltimore City Department of Planning, directed by Larry Reich while Brower was Chief of Comprehensive Planning and Chief of Design Analysis. Some readers may recognize material in various sections of the book that has appeared previously in environmental literature. Brower acknowledges the influence of Appleyard and Lynch on his work, and it is likely both leaders in the process-oriented school of urban design and planning would have approved of Brower's resulting volume, especially as an example of research informing practice. The book is organized into two parts. Brower begins by laying the groundwork of broad ideas about behavior and perception of place; familiarity, satisfaction, and characteristics of home environments; and the theory and process of design itself. In Part 1, the first chapter is devoted to three modes of perception-responsive, operational, and inferen-tial-and how differences in point of view can and should influence design response. Brower then draws upon the work of, among others, Fried, Lynch, Winkel, Appleyard, Rapoport, and Lansing and Marans, as well as his own studies in Baltimore, to carefully review how residents define and judge their home environment. The third chapter recognizes the different priorities of residents and outsiders in evaluating the environment, with Brower noting it is possible for both to find satisfaction in the same place. Brower presents his study in which residents and designers each look at photographs of the built environment to show how designers commonly focus on physical proportions and patterns while residents (nondesigners) attend more to what they can read into the surface qualities of a place. In the fifth chapter, Brower builds on several more Baltimore studies to argue for two roles in design and planning: (1) expert, acting on behalf of others, to come up with ideas and solutions; and (2) facilitator, helping others define and resolve their own problems. In his wrap-up chapter of theory and practice, he exhorts those working on housing design in high-threat urban areas to see the place the way the residents do-\&dquo;as a cabin in the wilderness (not a cottage in the country)\&dquo; and design for an appropriate refuge. Part 2 is Brower's research cache of case studies to provide the resident's-eye view of Harlem Park, a predominantly black, low-income neighborhood in Balti-more. One of the city's earliest renewal projects, it consists of thirty-two residential blocks, twenty-nine of which had inner-block parks created during the 1960s. Brower's thirteen years of research in Harlem Park included techniques such as interviews, observations, person counts, doll-play games with children, and interventions. Chapter nine is a delightful and insightful collection of transcripts, letters, and staff notes about several experiments connected with the mid-block parks, including design, management, and involvement. He follows this with a summary chapter, \&dquo;As Residents See It;' including views on streetfronts, back spaces, parks, near-home spaces, and community responsibilities. Some readers, anxious for the bottom line of how to make good residential environments that work well and are cared for, may turn first to the final chapter. There they will find the author's design guidelines. Practitioners and policy-makers will find Brower's thirteen design guidelines easily accessible and to the point. Those who have enjoyed the case material effectively presented in the previous chapters will find no surprises. Brower has earned the right to make these summary \&dquo;should\&dquo; statements. These summary statements deal primarily with the design of street space in high-density urban neighborhoods : let the residents keep it lively and well-used; let them watch it, own it, manage it, use it as recreational as well as circulation space; and, above all, let the residents make the design decisions.},

Recent research suggests that walking also promotes mental and physical health. The quality of the pedestrian environment is key to encouraging people to choose walking over driving. Six criteria are presented for design of a successful pedestrian network: (1) connectivity; (2) linkage with other modes; (3) fine grained land use patterns; (4) safety; (5) quality of path; and (6) path context.

Hence it is unsurprising that it continues to be one of the most active research areas of computer vision. Even after over three decades of intense research, the state-of-the-art in face recognition continues to improve, benefitting from advances in a range of different research fields such as image processing, pattern recognition, computer graphics, and physiology. Systems based on visible spectrum images, the most researched face recognition modality, have reached a significant level of maturity with some practical success. However, they continue to face challenges in the presence of illumination, pose and expression changes, as well as facial disguises, all of which can significantly decrease recognition accuracy. Amongst various approaches which have been proposed in an attempt to overcome these limitations, the use of infrared (IR) imaging has emerged as a particularly promising research direction. This paper presents a comprehensive and timely review of the literature on this subject. Our key contributions are (i) a summary of the inherent properties of infrared imaging which makes this modality promising in the context of face recognition; (ii) a systematic review of the most influential approaches, with a focus on emerging common trends as well as key differences between alternative methodologies; (iii) a description of the main databases of infrared facial images available to the researcher; and lastly (iv) a discussion of the most promising avenues for future research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, it is questionable whether models developed for low density situations can be used to simulate high density crowd movements. The objective of this paper is to assess the existent pedestrian simulation models with respect to known crowd phenomena in order to ascertain whether these models can indeed be used for the simulation of high density crowds and to indicate any gaps in the field of pedestrian simulation modeling research.This paper provides a broad, but not exhaustive overview of the crowd motion simulation models of the last decades. It is argued that any model used for crowd simulation should be able to simulate most of the phenomena indicated in this paper. In the paper cellular automata, social force models, velocity-based models, continuum models, hybrid models, behavioral models and network models are discussed. The comparison shows that the models can roughly be divided into slow but highly precise microscopic modeling attempts and very fast but behaviorally questionable macroscopic modeling attempts. Both sets of models have their use, which is highly dependent on the application the model has originally been developed for. Yet, for practical applications, that need both precision and speed, the current pedestrian simulation models are inadequate.},

A gait phase information retrieval algorithm was developed to analyze the duration of the phases in a gait cycle (i.e., stance, push-off, swing, and heel-strike phases). Based on the gait phase information, a decision tree based on the relations between gait phases was constructed for classifying three different walking patterns (level walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs). Gait phase information was also used for developing a walking distance estimation algorithm. The walking distance estimation algorithm consists of the processes of step count and step length estimation.

   abstract = {Background: Neighborhood built environment may profoundly influence children's physical activity (PA) and body weight. This study systematically reviewed scientific evidence regarding the impact of built environment on PA and obesity among children and adolescents in China. Methods: A keyword and reference search was conducted in Active Living Research, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science. Studies that met all of the following criteria were included in the review: (1) study designs—experimental studies, observational studies, and qualitative studies; (2) study subjects—Chinese children and/or adolescents aged ≤17 years; (3) exposures—neighborhood built environment; (4) outcomes—PA and/or body weight status; (5) article type—peer-reviewed publications; (6) time window of search—from the inception of an electronicbibliographic database to May 31, 2018; (7) country—China; and (8) language—articles written in English. Results: A total of 20 studies, including 16 cross-sectional studies, 3 longitudinal studies, and 1 descriptive study, met the predetermined selection criteria and were included in the review. A total of 13 studies adopted subjective built environment measures reported by parents and/or children,2 adopted objective measures (e.g., geographical information system, field observations), and 5 adopted both objective and subjective measures. PA behaviors included PA, physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, active/passive commuting from/to school, and park visits. Among the 16 studies that provided some quantitative estimates of the influence of built environment on PA and body weight status, all reported a statistically significant relationship in the expected direction. Availability and accessibility in proximity to greenspaces, parks, recreational facilities, and sidewalks were found to be associated with increased PA levels, reduced sedentary behaviors, and/or active commuting among Chinese childrenand adolescents. In contrast, the absence of bike lanes and living in higher density residential areas were associated with increased likelihood of childhood overweight and obesity. Conclusion: Neighborhood built environment plays an important role in Chinese children's PA engagement and weight outcomes. Building new exercise facilities and enhancing the accessibility of existing facilities hold the potential to enhance PA engagement among Chinese children and adolescents. In addition, urban designs that incorporate sidewalks, bike lanes, walking paths, less motorized traffic, and lower residential density are likely to promote PA and prevent childhood obesity in China.},

Method: Cross-sectional analyses were performed in spring 2012 on data collected from December 2008 until May 2010 for 284 middle school youth from a rural county and an adjacent urbanized area. Multivariable linear models estimated associations between BMI/MVPA and perceived environmental barriers/supports for physical activity and objectively measured neighborhood spatial variables. Results: Mean MVPA was significantly lower for rural youth (15.9. min/day) compared to urban youth (19.2. min/day). No differences were observed between rural and urban youth for BMI or BMI percentile. Significant differences in both perceived and objective correlates for MVPA and BMI percentile were found in multivariable models between rural and urban youth. Conclusion: Differences observed for correlates of MVPA and BMI across the settings suggest that rurality should be considered when identifying targets for intervention to promote MVPA and prevent adiposity in youth. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Due to the heterogeneity of identified studies a narrative synthesis was performed. Eleven trials (833 adults) were included. Most participants (6 trials; 523 adults) were young students. Study entry criteria and methods were sparsely reported. All interventions consisted of a single episode of walking or running indoors with the same activity at a similar level conducted outdoors on a separate occasion. A total of 13 different outcome measures were used to evaluate the effects of exercise on mental wellbeing, and 4 outcome measures were used to assess attitude to exercise. Most trials (n = 9) showed some improvement in mental wellbeing on one or other of the outcome measures. Compared with exercising indoors, exercising in natural environments was associated with greater feelings of revitalization and positive engagement, decreases in tension, confusion, anger, and depression, and increased energy. However, the results suggested that feelings of calmness may be decreased following outdoor exercise. Participants reported greater enjoyment and satisfaction with outdoor activity and declared a greater intent to repeat the activity at a later date. None of the identified studies measured the effects of physical activity on physical wellbeing or the effect of natural environments on exercise adherence. The hypothesis that there are added beneficial effects to be gained from performing physical activity outdoors in natural environments is very appealing and has generated considerable interest. This review has shown some promising effects on self-reported mental wellbeing immediately following exercise in nature which are not seen following the same exercise indoors. However, the interpretation and extrapolation of these findings is hampered by the poor methodological quality of the available evidence and the heterogeneity of outcome measures employed. The review demonstrates the paucity of high quality evidence on which to base recommendations and reveals an undoubted need for further research in this area. Large, well designed, longer term trials in populations who might benefit most from the potential advantages of outdoor exercise are needed to fully elucidate the effects on mental and physical wellbeing. The influence of these effects on the sustainability of physical activity initiatives also awaits investigation. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To examine the role of neighborhood social conditions and walking in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: A multi-level analysis of data from 4,317 older adults (mean age = 74.5; 73% black) from a geographically-defined urban community. Participants completed structured interviews including 14 questions on neighborhood conditions and self-reported walking. The neighborhood questions were summarized into individual-level measures of perceived neighborhood social cohesion and disorder. These measures were aggregated by neighborhood to construct neighborhood-level measures of social cohesion and disorder. Results: Neighborhood-level disorder, but not social cohesion, was significantly associated with walking, independent individual-level neighborhood perceptions and other correlates of walking. Further adjustment for race weakened this association to a marginally significant level. Discussion: Neighborhood conditions may shape walking behavior in older adults, especially conditions that reflect physical neglect or social threat. Promotion of walking behavior in older adults may require improvement of the safety and upkeep of the neighborhood environment. © 2009 Sage Publications.},

This paper examines the proposition that more walkable neighbourhoods encourage local social interaction, a sense of community, informal social control and social cohesion; and that the relationship is explained by walking for transport or for recreation. Multilevel analyses of data from an Australian sample showed a modest association between the walkability of a neighbourhood and sense of community only. Walking for transport, but not recreation, mediated this relationship although the effect was small. These results support contentions that 'walkability' is more complex than usually defined and that factors influencing neighbourhood sociability extend beyond issues of urban form.},

   abstract = {Many argue that monitoring conducted exclusively by scientists is insufficient to address ongoing environmental challenges. One solution entails the use of mobile digital devices in participatory monitoring (PM) programs. But how digital data entry affects programs with varying levels of stakeholder participation, from nonscientists collecting field data to nonscientists administering every step of a monitoring program, remains unclear. We reviewed the successes, in terms of management interventions and sustainability, of 107 monitoring programs described in the literature (hereafter programs) and compared these with case studies from our PM experiences in Australia, Canada, Ethiopia, Ghana, Greenland, and Vietnam (hereafter cases). Our literature review showed that participatory programs were less likely to use digital devices, and 2 of our 3 more participatory cases were also slow to adopt digital data entry. Programs that were participatory and used digital devices were more likely to report management actions, which was consistent with cases in Ethiopia, Greenland, and Australia. Programs engaging volunteers were more frequently reported as ongoing, but those involving digital data entry were less often sustained when data collectors were volunteers. For the Vietnamese and Canadian cases, sustainability was undermined by a mismatch in stakeholder objectives. In the Ghanaian case, complex field protocols diminished monitoring sustainability. Innovative technologies attract interest, but the foundation of effective participatory adaptive monitoring depends more on collaboratively defined questions, objectives, conceptual models, and monitoring approaches. When this foundation is built through effective partnerships, digital data entry can enable the collection of more data of higher quality. Without this foundation, or when implemented ineffectively or unnecessarily, digital data entry can be an additional expense that distracts from core monitoring objectives and undermines project sustainability. The appropriate role of digital data entry in PM likely depends more on the context in which it is used and less on the technology itself.},

Therefore, this research estimates on one hand, through an observational study, four models to establish the significant variables in the pedestrians' obedience of traffic signals in a signalized intersection. On the other hand, it was proven through surveys, the level of road safety knowledge and how the socioeconomic factors influence the probability that pedestrians obey traffic signals and do not engage in risky behaviors. For the observational study, the variables analyzed are the pedestrian characteristics, obedience to signs, vehicle interaction, the time of day, and the infrastructure. The existence of vehicular flow, that the pedestrian crossing is obstructed and that the pedestrian waits in a group, are the variables with the greatest influence on the probability that the pedestrian does not assume risky behaviors when crossing. The factors that influence the probability of obeying the pedestrian traffic light are the existence of vehicular flow, the user running, and the time of the day; factors for the compliance of the pedestrian crossing are that the crossing is obstructed, the number of lanes, and the presence of vehicular flow; while for the probability of running, factors for compliance are obedience to the traffic light, that the user crosses in the group, and the location of the pedestrian crossing. This study is a first approach to estimate the variables that influence the observance of traffic signals and risk behaviors.},

To make it a reality, autonomous vehicles require the ability to communicate with other road users and understand their intentions. Such interactions are essential between vehicles and pedestrians, the most vulnerable road users. Understanding pedestrian behavior, however, is not intuitive and depends on various factors, such as demographics of the pedestrians, traffic dynamics, environmental conditions, and so on. In this paper, we identify these factors by surveying pedestrian behavior studies, both the classical works on pedestrian-driver interaction and the modern ones that involve autonomous vehicles. To this end, we will discuss various methods of studying pedestrian behavior and analyze how the factors identified in the literature are interrelated. We will also review the practical applications aimed at solving the interaction problem, including design approaches for autonomous vehicles that communicate with pedestrians and visual perception and reasoning algorithms tailored to understanding pedestrian intention. Based on our findings, we will discuss the open problems and propose future research directions.},

As nonintrusive autonomous sensing and context recognition are desirable characteristics of a personal sensing system; efforts have been made to develop opportunistic sensing techniques on mobile phones. The resulting combination of these approaches has ushered in a new realm of applications, namely opportunistic user context recognition with mobile phones. This article surveys the existing research and approaches towards realization of such systems. In doing so, the typical architecture of a mobile-centric user context recognition system as a sequential process of sensing, preprocessing, and context recognition phases is introduced. The main techniques used for the realization of the respective processes during these phases are described, and their strengths and limitations are highlighted. In addition, lessons learned from previous approaches are presented as motivation for future research. Finally, several open challenges are discussed as possible ways to extend the capabilities of current systems and improve their real-world experience. © 2013 ACM.},

To balance the requirement of data collection and personal privacy, a lot of privacy-preserving data collection schemes are provided. A very important work of these schemes is to produce a secret position for every user to store her/his data, which is named secure arrangement. A novel secure arrangement method is proposed in this paper, which is based on matrix eigenvalue calculation. Compared with the current secure arrangement methods, the proposed method is more robust and efficient, which drives the proposed scheme to be more suitable for repeated aggregation. Then we use an example to illustrate how to use the proposed arrangement method to construct a privacy data collection protocol.

   abstract = {"Smart cities" are a buzzword of the moment. Although legal interest is growing, most academic responses at least in the EU, are still from the technological, urban studies, environmental and sociological rather than legal, sectors  and  have primarily laid emphasis on the social, urban, policing and environmental benefits of smart cities, rather than their challenges, in often a rather uncritical fashion. However a growing backlash from the privacy and surveillance sectors warns of the potential threat to personal privacy posed by smart cities. A key issue is the lack of opportunity in an ambient or smart city environment for the giving of meaningful consent to processing of personal data; other crucial issues include the degree to which smart cities collect private data from inevitable public interactions, the "privatisation" of  ownership of both infrastructure and data,  the repurposing of "big data" drawn from IoT in smart cities and the storage of that data in the Cloud. This paper, drawing on author engagement with smart city development in Glasgow as well as the results of an international conference in the area curated by the author, argues that smart cities combine the three greatest current threats to personal privacy, with which regulation has so far failed to deal effectively; the Internet of Things (IoT)  or "ubiquitous computing";  "Big Data"; and the Cloud. It seeks solutions both from legal institutions such as data protection law and from "code", proposing in particular from the ethos of Privacy by Design, a new "social impact assessment" and new human:computer interactions to promote user autonomy in ambient environments. },

These critiques are important, and to some extent, have set scholarly inquiry on a new, exciting and broader, trajectory than that offered by privacy scholars. On closer examination, however, these critiques are often based on some faulty assumptions about the contemporary framing of the privacy issue, and about the governance of the issue. Privacy, as a concept, regime, a set of policy instruments, and as a way to frame civil society activism, shows an extraordinary resilience. Surveillance scholars must learn to live with it.},

The research methodology is qualitative: a systematic and extensive literature review carried out by PRISMA method. Data and information from different case studies carried out globally assisted in the inductive approach. Content analysis identified smart city indicators and related criteria in the case study examples. The study concluded that smart people, smart living, and smart governance methods that have come into practice at a later stage are as important as smart mobility, smart environments, and smart economy measures that were implemented early on, and cities are opening up to new, transparent participatory governance approaches where citizens play a key role. It also illustrates that the current new wave of smart cities with real time data are promoting citizen participation focusing on human, social capital as an essential component in future cities.},

Firstly, an line-of-sight (LOS) Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model is established by RSSI value and actual distance between the Bluetooth-Low-Energy beacon and the terminal equipment. Secondly, based on the LOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model and the threshold-corrected RSSI peak, an NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model is established. Thirdly, the NLOS RSSI value is processed by the NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging model to obtain the optimal ranging value. Finally, high precision positioning coordinates can be obtained by using NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy positioning algorithm and optimal Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging. In this paper, two experiments are carried out, and the experimental results show that: in the range of 7 m, the average ranging accuracy of the improved NLOS Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging method is 0.37 m, which is improved 49.19% when compared to the traditional method’s results. The average positioning accuracy is 0.4 m using the positioning algorithm proposed in this paper. Therefore, in NLOS environment, the proposed ranging method and positioning algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of Bluetooth-Low-Energy ranging and positioning.},

   abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless protocol optimized for low-power communication. To design energy-efficient devices, the protocol provides a number of parameters that need to be optimized within an energy, latency, and throughput design space. Therefore, an energy model that can predict the energy consumption of a BLE-based wireless device for different parameter value settings is needed. As BLE differs from the well-known Bluetooth Basic Rate (BR) significantly, models for Bluetooth BR cannot be easily applied to the BLE protocol. In past years, there have been a couple of proposals on energy models for BLE. However, none of them can model all the operating modes of the protocol. This article presents an energy model of the BLE protocol, which allows the computation of a device's power consumption in all possible operating modes. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed model is not only one of the most accurate ones known so far (be-cause it accounts for all protocol parameters), but it is also the only one that models all the operating modes of BLE. Based on this model, guidelines for system designers are presented that help choose the right parameters for optimizing the energy consumption. The model is publicly available as a software library for download.},

   abstract = {Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) is a key technology in the envisioned Internet of Things (IoT) scenario. In fact, its extremely low-power characteristics make it one of the most suitable solutions to enable wireless communications among battery powered IoT objects ubiquitously deployed in the field with the aim of building smart environments. Although Bluetooth LE specification targets a specific set of applications mainly devoted to monitoring purposes, innovative solutions can lead to the adoption of such technology in different applications, such as multimedia streaming, allowing IoT objects to exploit new functionalities. In this direction this article presents BlueVoice, an application targeted to Bluetooth LE devices to enable speech streaming services. In the article BlueVoice is presented by first detailing the services set extension needed to support the new envisioned multimedia service, then a description of application choices is given, followed by an evaluation of its performance in real IoT objects. Thanks to the selected speech encoding technique, connection design choices and packetization strategies, BlueVoice application requires a communication bandwidth of 64.3 kbps to transmit audio at 16 kHz in ADPCM format. BlueVoice performance has been evaluated in terms of power consumption, memory and processing requirements, showing feasibility of the developed solution in resource constrained devices, thus confirming the correct choices in the application design. The set of performance information obtained show that BlueVoice is a viable solution to enable speech communications in ubiquitous wireless IoT nodes based on the Bluetooth LE technology.},

   abstract = {Previous indoor positioning research has mainly been focused on using Wi-Fi and RFID. In recent years, researchers began to study using Bluetooth 4.0 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor positioning purposes. In general, positioning techniques based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI), such as signal propagation and fingerprint, are commonly used in wireless/mobile networks. These techniques have certain limitations and tradeoff in terms of accuracy, ease of implementation and practical application/deployment. For example, both methods require a training process before deployment. In this paper, we present a decentralized BLE-based positioning protocol that does not require training before deployment. The training process can automatically be done on the fly by the anchor nodes. While the anchor nodes are broadcasting, they also scan for signals emitted by other anchors. This collaborative communication process exchanges location information and signal strength measurements between each anchor. This process builds a signal-to-distance reference list for the target node to estimate physical distance in a more accurate way. Experimentation in a real indoor environment shows that the proposed collaborative positioning method can achieve an error of 1.5 meters on average. This is generally applicable for most indoor positioning applications for locating people. Furthermore, its implementation is simple and practical, because it does not require training before positioning estimation and is adaptive to environmental changes.},

   abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the amount of energy that is required to successfully transmit information inside the Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) advertising packets. There are applications that require more than one BLE node to simultaneously transmit data. The BLE protocol utilizes a specific communication method termed the advertising mode to perform unidirectional broadcasts of data from the advertising devices. However, with an increased number of BLE devices advertising simultaneously, there will be inevitable packet collisions from the advertising devices. This results in a waste of energy, specifically in low-power applications where lower consumption is desirable to minimize the need for battery replacements. This paper examines a packet collision model for the BLE advertising mode with the results validated using experimental data. Our analysis shows that when the throughput of the BLE network starts to fall due to an increase in the number of packet collisions, the energy consumption of the BLE nodes increases exponentially with respect to the number of nodes.},

We found that using commodity 802.11 technology over a range of algorithms, approaches and environments, one can expect a median localization error of 10ft and 97th percentile of 30ft.

While RSS measurements are recognized to suffer from errors due to the random nature of the fading channel, proximity measurements, ie., knowing only whether or not two devices are in communication range, are often discussed without considering that they are affected by the same fading channel. Proximity measurements are actually just a binary quantization of RSS measurements. We use the Cramér-Rao bound (ORB) to compare the minimal attainable variances of unbiased sensor location estimators for the cases of RSS and proximity measurements. For completeness, we also present the CRB for sensor localization with systems using K-level quantized RSS (QRSS) measurements, of which proximity measurements are the special case: K = 2. Examples are presented for the case of one unknown-location sensor, and for the case of a 5 by 5 grid of sensors. These examples show that lower bounds for standard deviation in proximity-based systems are, as a rule of thumb, about 50% higher than the bounds for RSS-based systems. Furthermore, results are presented which show how many bits of quantization are necessary for a QRSS-based system to nearly achieve the bounds of an unquantized RSS system.},

Measurements have been conducted both in indoors and outdoors scenarios. Performance of BLE 5 is compared to a previous release of BLE 4 which is currently the most used technology in commercial wireless healthcare and medical devices. This new improved BLE version may continue fostering the success of BLE use in those application scenarios as well as enable novel Internet of Things solutions. The main goal of this work was to evaluate, experimentally, the communications range and throughput performance of BLE 5 coded version which claims to provide fourfold improvement to the previous version of BLE. Measurement results obtained using the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 chipset are reported for indoor and outdoor cases relevant to healthcare and medical scenarios. Results show the practical communications range and throughput of the BLE 5 coded version, giving insight about the possible application space improvements for BLE technology. Specifically, our measurements showed that BLE 5 coded mode provides approximately 9 dB radio link budget gain compared to BLE 4, which leads to more than twofold communications range improvement in line-of-sight outdoor scenario and 10–20% improvement in non-line-of-sight indoor scenario.},

Electromagnetic wave propagation models show that the attenuation by rain begins to have a significant impact for frequencies above 10 GHz. However, in some systems operating at 2.4 GHz there is packet loss when it is raining. So, a 2.4 GHz outdoor wireless sensor network was set up to study the influence of meteorological parameters in the received signal.

In spite of its benefits various problems and challenges are associated with implementing the compact city approach. This review looks at the effects of urban densification and compact city development on urban green space and its planning. It identifies problems, challenges and strategies of urban green space planning during densification processes. Findings confirm that urban densification processes, including consolidation and infill development, can pose a threat to urban green space. However, the literature on the compact city approach often lacks specific suggestions for urban green space conservation and planning. Provision of urban green space in compact city environments and during densification processes is described as a major challenge. Loss of private urban green space rarely seems offset by provision of more public green space. Several ways are identified to deal with these challenges, while also highlighting research gaps, e.g., as to how loss of green space quantity can be offset by increased green space quality.},

   abstract = {Cities play a prominent role in our economic development as more than 80 % of the gross world product (GWP) comes from cities. Only 600 urban areas with just 20 % of the world population generate 60 % of the GWP. Rapid urbanization, climate change, inadequate maintenance of water and wastewater infrastructures and poor solid waste management may lead to flooding, water scarcity, water pollution, adverse health effects and rehabilitation costs that may overwhelm the resilience of cities. These megatrends pose urgent challenges in cities as the cost of inaction is high. We present an overview about population growth, urbanization, water, waste, climate change, water governance and transitions. Against this background, we discuss the categorization of cities based on our baseline assessments, i.e. our City Blueprint research on 45 municipalities and regions predominantly in Europe. With this bias towards Europe in mind, the challenges can be discussed globally by clustering cities into distinct categories of sustainability and by providing additional data and information from global regions. We distinguish five categories of sustainability: (1) cities lacking basic water services, (2) wasteful cities, (3) water-efficient cities, (4) resource-efficient and adaptive cities and (5) water-wise cities. Many cities in Western Europe belong to categories 3 and 4. Some cities in Eastern Europe and the few cities we have assessed in Latin America, Asia and Africa can be categorized as cities lacking basic water services. Lack of water infrastructures or obsolete infrastructures, solid waste management and climate adaptation are priorities. It is concluded that cities require a long-term framing of their sectoral challenges into a proactive and coherent Urban Agenda to maximize the co-benefits of adaptation and to minimize the cost. Furthermore, regional platforms of cities are needed to enhance city-to-city learning and to improve governance capacities necessary to accelerate effective and efficient transitions towards water-wise cities. These learning alliances are needed as the time window to solve the global water governance crisis is narrow and rapidly closing. The water sector can play an important role but needs to reframe and refocus radically.},

Transforming urban processes will only be achieved with better urban governance. As gover-nance is embedded in institutions, it is the foundation for building the legitimate political and social mechanisms to green socio-ecological and economic systems. Yet the question of whether or not current governance systems in these processes are steering cities towards a greener economy, or if they are, how are they affecting people and ecosystems is yet to be addressed. Thus, we propose a set of governance indicators to assess the greening of urban processes that go beyond the decision-making procedures and include the capacity to implement change, the results of greening the economy and final outcomes on the ground. We also look at the obstacles, achievements and lessons in the greening of the direct and indirect economic processes in cities.},

   abstract = {Cities are key for sustainability and the radical systemic changes required to enable equitable human development within planetary boundaries. Their particular role in this regard has become the subject of an emerging and highly interdisciplinary scientific debate. Drawing on a qualitative literature review, this paper identifies and scrutinizes the principal fields involved, asking for their respective normative orientation, interdisciplinary constitution, theories and methods used, and empirical basis to provide orientations for future research. It recognizes four salient research epistemologies, each focusing on a distinct combination of drivers of change: (A) transforming urban metabolisms and political ecologies; (B) configuring urban innovation systems for green economies; (C) building adaptive urban communities and ecosystems; and (D) empowering urban grassroots niches and social innovation. The findings suggest that future research directed at cities and systemic change towards sustainability should (1) explore interrelations between the above epistemologies, using relational geography and governance theory as boundary areas; (2) conceive of cities as places shaped by and shaping interactions between multiple socio-technical and social-ecological systems; (3) focus on agency across systems and drivers of change, and develop corresponding approaches for intervention and experimentation; and (4) rebalance the empirical basis and methods employed, strengthening transdisciplinarity in particular.},

   abstract = {Published in June 2019, the new edition of the annually updated Renewables Global Status Report (GSR) compiles the most recent developments and trends in the adoption of renewable energies worldwide and in specific regions, countries and sectors. The report represents a rich resource for reliable and up-to-date information about individual renewable energy sources and their use. The analysis also covers a review of energy policies. Renewable energy policies still strongly concentrate on the power sector, while transport and heating and cooling are given less attention. Most investment in renewable energy today happens in developing and emerging countries, which is a major change to the situation some years ago. The 2019 edition of the GSR report includes a feature on renewable energy in cities, which highlights the importance of prioritising the urban context in order to achieve more sustainable schemes of energy supply and consumption. More than half of the global population today lives in cities, but around two-thirds of energy consumption happens in an urban environment. The GSR 2019 identifies that cities already are among the most active players in the adoption of renewable energies. One interesting finding is that in more than 100 cities worldwide at least 70% of the electricity already comes from renewables. This includes cities in both developed and developing countries.},

The purpose of this article is therefore to analyse how cities and municipalities can support and facilitate the circular economy through multiple modes of governance, e.g. through the use of own assets to support the circular economy; the use of the ownership of utilities and waste companies to support the circular economy; the use of rule enforcement and/or economic regulation or through facilitating, coordinating, collaborating and encouraging. The analysis in the article is based on two in-depth case studies of projects seeking circular economies, in which Danish municipalities collaborated with local stakeholders to close the material loop for demolition materials and textile waste. Overall, this study is based on an action research approach that emphasises the benefits of co-innovation processes carried out between multiple stakeholders. The analysis of the case studies concluded that municipalities can function as an important change agent to support and facilitate a transformation towards a circular economy.},

   abstract = {<p>To test simulation models of pedestrian flows, we have performed experiments for corridors, bottleneck areas, and intersections. Our evaluations of video recordings show that the geometric boundary conditions are not only relevant for the capacity of the elements of pedestrian facilities, they also influence the time gap distribution of pedestrians, indicating the existence of self-organization phenomena. After calibration of suitable models, these findings can be used to improve design elements of pedestrian facilities and egress routes. It turns out that “obstacles” can stabilize flow patterns and make them more fluid. Moreover, intersecting flows can be optimized, utilizing the phenomenon of “stripe formation.” We also suggest increasing diameters of egress routes in stadia, theaters, and lecture halls to avoid long waiting times for people in the back, and shock waves due to impatience in cases of emergency evacuation. Moreover, zigzag-shaped geometries and columns can reduce the pressure in panicking crowds. The proposed design solutions are expected to increase the efficiency and safety of train stations, airport terminals, stadia, theaters, public buildings, and mass events in the future. As application examples we mention the evacuation of passenger ships and the simulation of pilgrim streams on the Jamarat bridge. Adaptive escape guidance systems, optimal way systems, and simulations of urban pedestrian flows are addressed as well.</p>},

   abstract = {Urban sprawl and increasing population density in urban centers create the challenge to finding ways of sustainable transportation solutions that preserve the convenience of residents while reducing emissions. Therefore, walkability is a core urban design element because of being advantageous onto three fronts: health, livability, and sustainability. Adopting walkability as urban solution relieves conceptual and practical tensions between the individualistic interests manifested in the desire to own and use private cars, and the need to reduce transportation-based consumption. This review advocates that long-term health benefits from walking and physical activity are the premier incentive to repurpose our cities to be more sustainable and more walking friendly, and spark behavioral change into reducing car dependency for all daily transportations. The review inspects physical elements of the built environment that make the walking trip feasible and desirable, such as connectivity, accessibility, and closeness of destination points, presence of greenness and parks, commercial retail, and proximity to transit hubs and stations. Hence, this review explores a few popular walkability evaluation indices and frameworks that employ subjective, objective, and/or distinctive methods within variant environmental, cultural, and national context. There is no unified universal standardized walkability theory despite the need for rigorous evaluation tools for policy makers and developers. Furthermore, there is a lack of emphasis on air quality and thermal stress while approaching walkability, despite being important elements in the walking experience. Research opportunities in the field of walkability can leverage location tracking from smart devices and identify the interaction patterns of pedestrians with other transportation modes, especially for those with fundamental movement challenges such as wheelchair users.},

   abstract = {Objective Over 6400 American pedestrians die annually, a figure that is currently increasing. One hypothesised reason for the increasing trend is the role of mobile technology in distracting both pedestrians and drivers. Scientists and policy-makers have attended somewhat to distracted driving, but attention to distracted pedestrian behaviour has lagged. We will evaluate Bluetooth beacon technology as a means to alert and warn pedestrians when they approach intersections, reminding them to attend to the traffic environment and cross streets safely.

Methods Bluetooth beacons are small devices that broadcast information unidirectionally within a closed proximal network. We will place beacons at an intersection frequently trafficked by urban college students. From there, the beacons will transmit to an app installed on users’ smartphones, signalling users to attend to their environment and cross the street safely. A cross-over trial will evaluate the app with 411 adults who frequently cross the target intersection on an urban university campus. We will monitor those participants’ behaviour over three distinct time periods: (1) 3 weeks without the app being activated, (2) 3 weeks with the app activated and (3) 4 weeks without the app activated to assess retention of behaviour. Throughout the 10-week period, we will gather information to evaluate whether the intervention changes distracted pedestrian behaviour using a logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of key behavioural outcome measures and adjusting for any residual confounding. We also will test for changes in perceived risk. The trial will follow CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement guidelines, as modified for cross-over design studies.

Conclusion If this program proves successful, it offers exciting implications for future testing and ultimately for broad distribution to reduce distracted pedestrian behavior. We discuss issues of feasibility, acceptability and scalability.},

It can provide information to pedestrians about the location and directions of a crosswalk, and the traffic signal status. In general, a pedestrian who is visually impaired uses a 358.5MHz wireless remote controller to activate the APS and crosses at the crosswalk with the help of the APS. The existing APS can only receive an activation message from the remote controller. Therefore, the APS has an issue, especially at intersections, that all APSs within the communication range of the remote controller are activated simultaneously. It makes to confuse the visual impaired pedestrians. In this paper, we propose a BLE-enabled APS that can enable two-way communication via Bluetooth with a smartphone.

Accidents with pedestrians are very often the result of various factors related to the infrastructure and behaviour of pedestrians and drivers. The objective of the work was to assess driver and pedestrian behaviour in pedestrian crossing areas. The research also served as a pilot study for similar work to be conducted across Poland, and constituted the basis for monitoring the behaviour of road users in the area of pedestrian crossings. Parameters which must be analysed were identified on the basis of field studies. Principles of selecting test sites were adopted, and measurement methods for pedestrian crossing areas are presented. The influence of the location of the selected test cross-section infrastructure parameters on the behaviour of road users in pedestrian crossing areas is demonstrated. The results of the study will be used as a basis for new solutions involving pedestrian crossing infrastructure designed to improve pedestrian safety. The results were also used in formulating new regulations for the design and maintenance of pedestrian crossings and recommendations for road safety auditors.</p>},

In particular, the proposed system relies on a wearable device that combines image recognition and localization capabilities to automatically provide the users with cultural contents related to the observed artworks. The localization information is obtained by a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) infrastructure installed in the museum. Moreover, the system interacts with the Cloud to store multimedia contents produced by the user and to share environment-generated events on his/her social networks. Finally, several location-aware services, running in the system, control the environment status also according to users' movements. These services interact with physical devices through a multiprotocol middleware. The system has been designed to be easily extensible to other IoT technologies and its effectiveness has been evaluated in the MUST museum, Lecce, Italy.},

   abstract = {With the huge advances in the field of wireless communication technologies and the availability of large volume of data on customers, it becomes imperative to develop a system that can be used in shopping center to make shopping more enjoyable and efficient for the customer and the monitoring real-time easier for the store's management. A Geomarketing system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is developed. This BLE-based system consists of three key components (i) Server component (ii) smartphone component, and (iii) beacons (BLE). The smartphone application detects the location of customers by using BLE technology, this data will be transferred to server component by WIFI, and the server application sends personalized promotions such as mobile advertisements or e-coupons to customers' smartphones. In this paper, a highly scalable marketing system using Beacon and the smartphone applicationwas built to send push notifications to users based on the current location of customer inside the mall. Content was provided to people in order to increase sales. This work aims to demonstrate that the geomarketing system is able to detect the location of the customer, transmit the location's data via WIFI, display personalized promotions in a smartphone. The results show that implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology in this system highly reduces the power consumption of the long-term monitoring system.},

Yet, some applications such as virtual reality and augmented reality are in great need of services provided by indoor positioning technology. This paper presents an indoor positioning method and system based on iBeacons, which are a kind of low energy Bluetooth gadgets proposed by Apple. An array of iBeacons are deployed in an indoor environment to periodically emit signals which can be received by a mobile phone. The distance between the mobile phone and the iBeacons can be obtained by RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) ranging model. The position can be calculated according the three-ball positioning algorithm whenever three or more signals are received. A lot of experiments have been accomplished and the results show that the positioning accuracy can be acquired less than 1.1 m. Thus, the system can meet the requirements of many indoor positioning application scenarios.},

As such, this paper validates the impact of vehicle obstruction on signal propagation using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based on the wireless channel measurements of realistic environmental obstruction at 2.4 GHz frequency band. Low mobility IEEE 802.15.4 XBee S2C compliant device which is designed to collect received signal power was used and these devices were deployed at area congested with cars. The channel measurements were conducted on LOS car parking area with two scenarios; single-sided and double-sided vehicle obstruction which mimics the obstruction of metal objects. The effect of existing vehicle on the signal propagation is demonstrated based on RSSI and RMSE. The attenuation profile of vehicular obstruction on wireless signal is modeled and compared with large-scale propagation models. Results show that metal object significantly reduce transmission range and signal power. The findings may incite for future implementation of cooperative deployment program and internet of things (IoT) applications in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication.},

The article presents a comparative analysis of determining coordinates’ principles by the AOA, TOA, TDOA and RSSI methods. It is proposed to use BLE technologies based on the RSSI data received from base stations. Using the triangulation method, formulas are obtained for solving the problem of determining the coordinates of an object moving in space. The software and hardware complex architecture has been developed. It is proposed to use ESP32 modules as base radio stations. The RSSI value is very unstable, so the positioning accuracy will depend on the number of base stations and the additional software tools used.},

WiFi Fingerprinting using a mobile phone is perhaps the most widely used method. However, this is power-hungry, and its typical positioning accuracy (2.0 to 3.0 meters) is not enough to differentiate between adjacent narrow aisles to locate items. In this paper, we present a novel (Bluetooth Low Energy) BLE Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) ranking based fingerprinting method that uses Kendall Tau Correlation Coefficient (KTCC) to correlate a new signal position with the signal strength ranking of multiple low-power iBeacon devices situated in a retail space. This offers a higher positioning accuracy and is supported in recent smartphones. An important source of error is the RSSI, which varies depending on the model and orientation of the phone. We present a novel way to mitigate this. We validated our method in a retail-like indoor space of Queen Mary Library. We achieved an average positioning error of 0.87 meters which was sufficient to differentiate between physical space aisles.},

The use of the discrete choice framework is justified by its flexibility, the capacity to deal with individuals and the compatibility with agent-based simulation. The model is calibrated using data from actual pedestrian movements, manually taken from video sequences. We present two different formulations: a cross-nested logit and a mixed nested logit.

One of the strategies of many smart urban mobility policies is to view the transportation system from a holistic perspective to seek reduction of negative effects and an improve performance. Nonetheless, given the rapid technological advances in the transportation sector, there is a need to identify and evaluate primary smart mobility innovations from a sustainability perspective. This article presents a thorough technology review and evaluation of the main smart mobility innovations identified in the literature. The study has identified and categorized six main smart mobility innovations most commonly discussed within the literature including: (a) intelligent transport systems; (b) alternative fuel systems; (c) driving automation systems; (d) shared mobility services; (e) demand responsive transport; and (f) integrated mobility systems. Furthermore, this article includes a brief description of their characteristics, applications, and also evaluates their sustainability according to their proposed impacts on transport safety, road congestion, energy consumption, the environment, and accessibility.},

   abstract = {Purpose of review: In this paper, we seek to elucidate the impact of car-free days and events on human health. Car-free days and events are often designed to alleviate the impact of transportation-related air pollution, noise, physical inactivity, traffic congestion, or other detrimental externalities of private motor vehicle travel. We reviewed existing peer-reviewed and gray literature to understand the variety of potential public health impacts that have been measured as a result of car-free days or events and associated changes in environmental exposures and lifestyles. Recent findings: The impacts of car-free days and events are highly variable and seem to depend on the scope (frequency, duration, and geographic size) and goals of each car-free day and event. Most of the existing literature measures impacts in terms of air and noise pollution and some studies focus on physical activity metrics. In some cases, car-free days and events were successful in reducing the concentration of certain air pollutants but had little or adverse impacts on the concentration of others. Often, traffic is diverted from cordoned areas to surrounding streets, displacing traffic congestion and adverse environmental exposures to other areas of a city, with potential understudied implications to environmental justice. Summary: Car-free days and events are often an attractive policy option; however, they require intensive planning to be successful. The organization and execution of car-free days and events, as well as public support and stakeholder engagement, greatly influence the level of success and the sustainability of such initiatives. Health benefits may be a palatable and convincing argument to the general public. However, very few studies focus on actual health impacts associated with car-free days and events. Future research could be most useful if it focused on measuring health outcomes associated with car-free days and events through longitudinal studies.},

Urbanization has major impacts on ecosystem services, and therefore human well-being, but not all groups within a community experience the impacts of urbanization on ecosystem services the same. It is important for decision-makers to understand the trade-offs that occur with urbanization, as it relates to ecosystem services provision, as well as the perceptions of importance of ecosystem services among a population. In this paper, we measured a)areas at environmental risk due to urban growth, b)differences in societal demand for ecosystem services between socio-demographic groups, c)perceptions of urban and agricultural impacts to ecosystem services, and d)public awareness of current ecosystem services trends, in the Boise, Idaho, metropolitan area, one of the fastest-growing areas in the United States. We applied urban growth projections to current land use-land cover, and found that agriculture is at highest risk of conversion. We then conducted over 400 face-to-face survey, measuring whether perceptions regarding ecosystem services from urban and agricultural land differ between socio-demographic groups. We found significant differences regarding perceived importance of ecosystem services. The general public placed higher importance on food production and alternative energy while experts placed higher importance on water quality and recreation. Overall, respondents perceived that urban land use negatively impacts more ecosystem services than agriculture land use. Urban areas were associated with positive impacts to local identity and recreation, while agriculture was positively associated with cultural heritage and food production. Both urban and agriculture land uses were negatively associated with water quality, air quality, and habitat for species with urban land having greater, negative impacts. Our results indicate a need to incorporate social demand for ecosystem services in urban planning, to ensure policy resilience and to appropriately address diverse perspectives.},

   abstract = {The Brazilian transport system is based on the use of highways and road heavy-duty trucks are the main type of vehicle to perform this activity. There are more than 1 million km of highways in the country and the search for alternative technologies to reduce emissions from the transport industry is increasing. The Blue Corridor research started to replace heavy-duty vehicles fueled by conventional diesel to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and its effect on pollutant emissions reductions. In this context, this paper aims at evaluating the atmospheric dispersion of particulate matter (PM) from road heavy-duty trucks in 12 cities in the São Paulo State, assessing the impacts of the replacement of full fleet powered by diesel to LNG and the effects on the health of the local population. The model AERMOD was used to simulate the dispersion of PM produced by heavy-duty vehicles fuel combustion and the methodology suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used to analyze the number of deaths attributed to the PM emitted. Results showed some municipalities with high PM concentrations, which exceeded the limits suggested by WHO. In terms of health issues, cardiovascular diseases in a population older than 30 years were the main cause of death from PM emissions. When it comes to fuel replacement, LNG helps to reduce PM emissions, but considering this reduction alone is not sufficient to avoid attributable deaths.},

   abstract = {Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behaviour consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to 70% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends, couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because of its “non-aerodynamic” shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among individuals.},

   abstract = {This paper concerns a review and critical assessment of the existing research on pedestrian behaviour in urban areas, focusing on two separate yet complementary aspects: route choice and crossing behaviour. First, an exhaustive review of the existing route choice models for pedestrians is presented. It is shown that the existing models are mainly more stochastic and more macroscopic than required and seldom incorporate the interactions between pedestrians and traffic. Second, the existing models on pedestrians crossing behaviour are presented and assessed. It is shown that, although their approach is usually detailed, deterministic and traffic-oriented, they are mainly devoted to a local level behaviour and focus on only one type of all the potential determinants. Most importantly, these two complementary and possibly interdependent aspects of pedestrian behaviour are always examined separately. The results of this review reveal a lack of an overall and detailed consideration of pedestrian behaviour along an entire trip in urban areas. Moreover, the need for an integrated approach based on flexibility, disaggregation and more determinism is identified. Accordingly, a set of modelling techniques are discussed as a general framework for further research in the field. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Microscopic pedestrian simulation models can be used to investigate pedestrian movement at the urban block and building model scale. In order to develop, calibrate and validate such microscopic models, highly accurate and detailed data on pedestrian movement and interaction behavior (e.g. collision avoidance) is required. We present a data collection approach for studying pedestrian behavior which uses the increasingly popular low-cost sensor Microsoft Kinect. The Kinect captures both standard camera data and a three-dimensional depth map. Our human detection and tracking algorithm is based on agglomerative clustering of privacy-preserving Kinect depth data captured from an elevated view - in contrast to the lateral view used for gesture recognition in Kinect gaming applications. Our approach transforms local Kinect 3D data to a common world coordinate system in order to obtain human trajectories from multiple Kinects, which allows for a scalable and flexible capturing area. At a testbed with real-world pedestrian traffic we demonstrate that our approach can provide accurate trajectories from three Kinects with a Pedestrian Detection Rate of up to 94% and a Multiple Object Tracking Precision of 4. cm. Using a comprehensive dataset of 2674 captured human trajectories we calibrate three variations of the Social Force model. Data for model calibration and validation was recorded without any script and without actors behaving according to scripted situations. Various conditions have been covered in the dataset, such as walking at different densities, walking-stopping-walking, abrupt changes of direction and random movement. The results of our model validations indicate their particular ability to reproduce the observed pedestrian behavior in microscopic simulations.},

   abstract = {This study focuses on social pedestrian groups in public spaces and makes an effort to identify the type of social relation between the group members. As a first step for this identification problem, we focus on dyads (i.e. 2 people groups). Moreover, as a mutually exclusive categorization of social relations, we consider the domain-based approach of Bugental, which precisely corresponds to social relations of colleagues, couples, friends and families, and identify each dyad with one of those relations. For this purpose, we use anonymized trajectory data and derive a set of observables thereof, namely, inter-personal distance, group velocity, velocity difference and height difference. Subsequently, we use the probability density functions (pdf) of these observables as a tool to understand the nature of the relation between pedestrians. To that end, we propose different ways of using the pdfs. Namely, we introduce a probabilistic Bayesian approach and contrast it to a functional metric one and evaluate the performance of both methods with appropriate assessment measures. This study stands out as the first attempt to automatically recognize social relation between pedestrian groups. Additionally, in doing that it uses completely anonymous data and proves that social relation is still possible to recognize with a good accuracy without invading privacy. In particular, our findings indicate that significant recognition rates can be attained for certain categories and with certain methods. Specifically, we show that a very good recognition rate is achieved in distinguishing colleagues from leisure-oriented dyads (families, couples and friends), whereas the distinction between the leisure-oriented dyads results to be inherently harder, but still possible at reasonable rates, in particular if families are restricted to parent-child groups. In general, we establish that the Bayesian method outperforms the functional metric one due, probably, to the difficulty of the latter to learn observable pdfs from individual trajectories.},

   abstract = {Physical distancing, as a measure to contain the spreading of Covid-19, is defining a “new normal”. Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: “in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?”, “Are there repeated offenders?”, and “How are new crowd management measures performing?”. Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.},

This paper presents a probabilistic model of pedestrian behavior to signalized crosswalks. In order to model the behavior of pedestrian, we take not only pedestrian physical states but also contextual information into account. We propose a model based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network which integrates relationships among the intersection context information and the pedestrian behavior in the same way as a human. The particle filter is used to estimate the pedestrian states, including position, crossing decision and motion type. Experimental evaluation using real traffic data shows that this model is able to recognize the pedestrian crossing decision in a few seconds from the traffic signal and pedestrian position information. This information is assumed to be obtained with the development of Connected Vehicle.},

New sources of sensor information—for example, smart devices such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, etc.—can support enhanced pedestrian behavior models. The objective of this article is the development and implementation of a V2Xpedestrian collision avoidance system that uses new information sources. Methods: A literature review of existing state-of-the-art pedestrian collision avoidance systems, pedestrian behavior models in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and traffic simulations is conducted together with an analysis of existing studies on typical pedestrian patterns in traffic. Based on this analysis, possible parameters for predicting pedestrian behavior were investigated. The results led to new requirements from which a concept was developed and implemented. Results: The analysis of typical pedestrian behavior patterns in traffic situations showed the complexity of predicting pedestrian behavior. Requirements for an improved behavior prediction were derived. A concept for a V2X collision avoidance system, based on a cost function that predicts pedestrian near future presence, and its implementation is presented. The concept presented considers several challenges such as information privacy, inaccuracies of the localization, and inaccuracies of the prediction. Conclusion: A concept for an enhanced V2X pedestrian collision avoidance system was developed and introduced. The concept uses new information sources such as smart devices to improve the prediction of the pedestrian's presence in the near future and considers challenges that come along with the usage of these information sources.},

   abstract = {Autonomous driving is not only required to detect pedestrians around vehicles, but also expected to understand the behaviors of pedestrians. Pedestrian body orientation and head orientation are the relevant indicators of the pedestrian intention. This paper proposes an accurate estimation system to recognize the pedestrian body orientation and the pedestrian head orientation from on-board camera and inertial sensors. The proposed system discretizes the body orientation and the head orientation into 16 directions. In order to achieve the accurate orientation estimation, a novel training database is established, which includes strongly labeled data and weakly labeled data. Semi-Supervised Learning method is employed to annotate the weakly labeled data, and to generate the accurate classifier based on the proposed training database. In addition, the temporal constraint and the human physical model constraint are considered in orientation estimation, which are beneficial to the reasonable and stable result of orientation estimation for the pedestrian in image sequences. This estimated result is the orientation in camera space. The comprehension of the pedestrian behavior needs to be conducted in the real world space. Therefore, this paper proposes to model the motion of the host vehicle using inertial sensor, then transforms the estimated orientation from camera space to the real world space by considering the vehicle and pedestrian motion. The represented orientation indicates the behavior of the pedestrian more directly. Finally, a series of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pedestrian orientation system.},

   abstract = {IntroductionTo combat and mitigate the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, reducing the number of social contacts within a population is highly effective. Non-pharmaceutical policy interventions, e.g. stay-at-home orders, closing schools, universities, and (non-essential) businesses, are expected to decrease pedestrian flows in public areas, leading to reduced social contacts. The extent to which such interventions show the targeted effect is often measured retrospectively by surveying behavioural changes. Approaches that use data generated through mobile phones are hindered by data confidentiality and privacy regulations and complicated by selection effects. Furthermore, access to such sensitive data is limited. However, a complex pandemic situation requires a fast evaluation of the effectiveness of the introduced interventions aiming to reduce social contacts. Location-based sensor systems installed in cities, providing objective measurements of spatial mobility in the form of pedestrian flows, are suited for such a purpose. These devices record changes in a population’s behaviour in real-time, do not have privacy problems as they do not identify persons, and have no selection problems due to ownership of a device.
ObjectiveThis work aimed to analyse location-based sensor measurements of pedestrian flows in 49 metropolitan areas at 100 locations in Germany to study whether such technology is suitable for the real-time assessment of behavioural changes during a phase of several different pandemic-related policy interventions.
MethodsSpatial mobility data of pedestrian flows was linked with policy interventions using the date as a unique linkage key. Data was visualised to observe potential changes in pedestrian flows before or after interventions. Furthermore, differences in time series of pedestrian counts between the pandemic and the pre-pandemic year were analysed.
ResultsThe sensors detected changes in mobility patterns even before policy interventions were enacted. Compared to the pre-pandemic year, pedestrian counts were 85% lower.
ConclusionsThe study illustrated the practical value of sensor-based real-time measurements when linked with non-pharmaceutical policy intervention data. This study’s core contribution is that the sensors detected behavioural changes before enacting or loosening non-pharmaceutical policy interventions. Therefore, such technologies should be considered in the future by policymakers for crisis management and policy evaluation.},

   abstract = {To investigate the impact of social groups on waiting behaviour of passengers at railway platforms a method to identify social groups through the monitoring of distances between pedestrians and the stability of those distances over time is introduced. The method allows the recognition of groups using trajectories only and thus opens up the possibility of studying crowds in public places without constrains caused by privacy protection issues. Trajectories from a railway platform in Switzerland were used to analyse the waiting behaviour of passengers in dependence of waiting time as well as the size of social groups. The analysis of the trajectories shows that the portion of passengers travelling in groups reaches up to 10% during the week and increases to 20% on the weekends. 60% of the groups were pairs, larger groups were less frequent. With increasing group size, the mean speed of the members decreases. Individuals and pairs often choose waiting spots at the sides of the stairs and in vicinity of obstacles, while larger groups wait close to the platform entries. The results indicate that passengers choose waiting places according to the following criteria and ranking: shortest ways, direction of the next intended action, undisturbed places and ensured communication. While individual passengers often wait in places where they are undisturbed and do not hinder others, the dominating comfort criterion for groups is to ensure communication. The results regarding space requirements of waiting passengers could be used for different applications. E.g. to enhance the level of service concept assessing the comfort of different types of users, to avoid temporary bottlenecks to improve the boarding and alighting process or to increase the robustness of the performance of railway platforms during peak loads by optimising the pedestrian distribution.},

The design of rural public spaces, especially in relation to the street network’s spatial configuration, significantly affects how villagers interact with one another. This research investigated the influence of street network space on the regional social interaction preferences of rural community populations by applying space syntax theory. Three typical villages in southern Anhui, China, were the subject of an observation analysis of social behaviors and pedestrian volumes on street networks. Using a segment model, it was possible to determine seven spatial configuration attributes of streets, including depth to the village entrance (DtoE), connectivity, curvature, the normalized angle choice (NACH) and integration (NAIN) with two radii. A considerable joint effect of street spatial type and spatial layout attributes on the regional social interaction preferences of rural community populations was found by MANOVA and stepwise regression analysis. The sampled community tends to engage in social activities in branch streets, and the pedestrian volume contained 67.1% of all the observed people in the street networks. Streets’ spatial attributes with lower NACH or NAIN levels (less usability or accessibility) and higher DtoE or curvature levels (more privacy or deformation) have greater influences on community pedestrian volumes. Regarding street type, the in-between space was found to have the most significant effect on the pedestrian volume of the branch streets, which are the preferred zones of community populations in the context of social activities.},

In particular, it focuses on the application of these new sources of data in retail analysis. Our goal is to integrate data derived through novel pedestrian counting and point-of-sale systems to build a statistical model that captures the relationship between retail turnover and footfall in the UK. The point-of-sales data are provided by two UK-based food \& beverage retailers. To accurately measure the pedestrian activity around retail units, we make use of the data generated by the SmartStreetSensor project: a deployment of a large network of sensors installed across 105 towns and cities in the UK that collect Wi-Fi probe requests generated by mobile devices. We propose and implement novel methods for processing these raw signals into accurate estimates of pedestrian activity without compromising participants' privacy. The resulting data is then integrated into seasonal ARIMA and dynamic regression models that can be used to predict future sales. Our results indicate that the dynamic regression model that accounts for fluctuations in footfall data outperforms seasonal ARIMA model that uses only past values and behaviours of transaction data to predict future sales. Thus, we conclude that footfall does have a strong impact on retail sales and therefore integrating footfall measures into sales forecasting can significantly improve the forecasting results. We also examine differences between the two retailers and observe a stronger correlation at the Fast Food Retailer locations compared to the correlation at Family Restaurant locations.},

   abstract = {Older adults’ out-of-home behaviors (OOHBs) are critical for maintaining health and quality of life. Taking Singapore’s Yuhua East as a case, this study applied a qualitative approach to explore what neighborhood environmental factors influence older adults’ OOHBs. Twelve older adults were recruited for walk-along interviews through the use of purposeful convenience sampling. A content analysis was conducted using NVivo 11 via an inductive approach. Research results revealed 12 categories of environmental factors that affected older adults’ OOHBs: access to facilities (shops and services, public transit, and connectivity), pedestrian infrastructure (sidewalk quality, sheltered walkways, universal design, crossings, benches, and public toilets), aesthetics (natural elements, buildings, noise, and cleanliness), traffic safety (behavior of other road users and road width), safety from crime, wayfinding, familiarity (long-term residency and routine activities), weather, social contact, high-rise, high-density (lifts, population density, flat size, and privacy), affordability (shops and services, as well as transportation), and maintenance and upgrading. This analysis concluded that access to facilities and pedestrian infrastructure are important for older adults’ OOHBs. Considering Singapore’s weather, sheltered walkways, the proximity of facilities and connectivity should be given serious emphasis. In addition to physical factors, social contacts and the affordability of shops and services are also important.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a collision avoidance system is presented to detect red light running and warn nearby vehicles and pedestrians in real time in order to prevent possible accidents. No complex infrastructure-based solution such as those based on radars or cameras is here required. Instead, a new solution based on smartphones carried by drivers and pedestrians is proposed so that it is the device inside the vehicle violating a traffic light, the one that self-reports the offence in order to generate alerts and warn nearby vehicles and pedestrians to prevent accidents. The proposal could also be used by road authorities to collect data on traffic lights that are most frequently violated in order to define an action plan to investigate causes and look for solutions. It includes a classifier for learning and estimating driver behaviour based on collected data, which is used to predict whether he/she is about to run a red light or detect whether that has already happened. In the first case, the system broadcasts warnings directly to close vehicles and pedestrians through Wi-Fi, while in the second case, the proposal warns vehicles and pedestrians in the neighbourhood through a server. The solution also includes a prioritization system based on changing traffic lights at intersections according to the needs and characteristics of the traffic at all times, giving the top priority to emergency vehicles. Furthermore, the proposal involves the use of cryptographic schemes to protect authenticity and integrity of messages sent from traffic lights, smartphones and servers, and privacy and anonymity to promote the use of the system. A beta version with some parts of the proposal has been implemented and the obtained results are promising.},

An important part of the study of DP is understanding the cognitive biases they exploit. A cognitive bias is a ‘systematic (that is, non-random and, thus, predictable) deviation from rationality in judgement or decision-making’. DP exploit them, negatively affecting the data subject’s decision-making process. In the present Article, I propose a taxonomy for DP. The overall goal of the proposed taxonomy is to help us to better understand and address the legal challenges behind DP, especially how designers affect the data subject’s decision-making process. The GDPR is silent about the exploitation of cognitive biases, manipulative interface designs and negative interferences in the decision-making process. It also misses the opportunity to unpack the fairness principle and to present occasions in which unfair practices could spread within the data protection realm, for example through design. To curb DP, fairness is a central concept, as it reflects the need to balance the asymmetries between controllers and data subjects.},

While there is a huge potential to benefit the society using such technologies, there is also an urgent need to identify the checks and balances to ensure that the impact of such technologies is ethical and positive. For instance, if the multimedia technologies are being used to detect and protect pedestrians from accidents by autonomous vehicles, then the pedestrian detection performance needs to be equitable across demographic descriptors, such as gender and race of the pedestrians. Similarly, while logs of driving behaviors are important in many applications, making such information available to corporate entities and third parties could raise important privacy challenges.

Although this tragic incident is but one among many terrible crowd disasters that occur during pilgrimage, sports events, or other mass gatherings, it stands out for it has been well documented: there were a total of seven security cameras monitoring the Loveparade and the chain of events that led to disaster was meticulously reconstructed. In this paper, we present an automatic, video-based analysis of the events in Duisburg. While physical models and simulations of human crowd behavior have been reported before, to the best of our knowledge, automatic vision systems that detect congestions and dangerous crowd turbulences in real world settings were not reported yet. Derived from lessons learned from the video footage of the Loveparade, our system is able to detect motion patterns that characterize crowd behavior in stampedes. Based on our analysis, we propose methods for the detection and early warning of dangerous situations during mass events. Since our approach mainly relies on optical flow computations, it runs in real-time and preserves privacy of the people being monitored. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {One of the main and most effective measures to contain the recent viral outbreak is the maintenance of the so-called Social Distancing (SD). To comply with this constraint, governments are adopting restrictions over the minimum inter-personal distance between people. Given this actual scenario, it is crucial to massively measure the compliance to such physical constraint in our life, in order to figure out the reasons of the possible breaks of such distance limitations, and understand if this implies a potential threat. To this end, we introduce the Visual Social Distancing (VSD) problem, defined as the automatic estimation of the inter-personal distance from an image, and the characterization of related people aggregations. VSD is pivotal for a non-invasive analysis to whether people comply with the SD restriction, and to provide statistics about the level of safety of specific areas whenever this constraint is violated. We first point out that measuring VSD is not only a geometrical problem, but it also implies a deeper understanding of the social behaviour in the scene. The aim is to truly detect potentially dangerous situations while avoiding false alarms (e.g., a family with children or relatives, an elder with their caregivers), all of this by complying with current privacy policies. We then discuss how VSD relates with previous literature in Social Signal Processing and indicate a path to research new Computer Vision methods that can possibly provide a solution to such problem. We conclude with future challenges related to the effectiveness of VSD systems, ethical implications and future application scenarios.},

We present a probabilistic framework utilizing a generative scene model to jointly exploit the multi-view image evidence, allowing us to detect people from arbitrary viewpoints. Our approach makes use of mean-field variational inference to not only estimate the maximum a posteriori (MAP) state but to also approximate the posterior probability distribution of people present in the scene. Evaluation shows state-of-the-art results on a novel data set for indoor people detection and tracking in depth images from the top-view with high perspective distortions. Furthermore it can be demonstrated that our approach (compared to the the mono-view setup) successfully exploits the multi-view image evidence and robustly converges in only a few iterations.},

   abstract = {As the number of passengers at border entry points such as airports and rail stations increases, so does the demand for seamless, secure, and fast biometric technologies for verification purposes. Although fingerprints are currently useful biometric technologies, they are intrusive and slow down the end-to-end verification process, increasing the chances of tampering. Emerging as an alternative technology, soft biometrics have proven successful for non-intrusive and rapid verification. Soft biometrics consists of a large set of features from three different modalities of the human body, including the face, body, and essential \& auxiliary attachments. This paper proposes a multi-channel soft biometrics framework that leverages soft biometrics technology over traditional biometrics. The framework encapsulates four distinct components: ApparelNet, which verifies essential and auxiliary attachments; A-Net, which measures anthropometric soft biometrics; OneDetect, which predicts global soft biometrics; and RSFS, which develops a set of highly relevant and supportive soft biometrics for verification. The proposed framework addresses several critical limitations of existing biometrics technologies during the verification process at border entry points, such as intrusive behavior, response time, biometric tampering, and privacy issues. The proposed multi-channel soft biometrics framework has been evaluated using several benchmark datasets in the field, such as Front-view Gait (FVG), Pedestrian Attribute Recognition At Far Distance (PETA), and Multimedia and Vision (MMV) Pedestrian. Using heterogeneous datasets enables the testing of each framework component or channel against numerous constrained and unconstrained scenarios. The outcome of the envisioned multi-channel soft biometrics framework is presented based on distinct outcomes from each channel, but it remains focused on determining a single cumulative verification score for verification at border control. In addition, this multi-channel soft biometrics framework has extended applications in several fields, including crowd surveillance, the fashion industry, and e-learning.},

Then, according to different risk scenarios, cognitive learning is carried out for different risk levels, the cognitive results and corresponding operations are fed back to the intelligent vehicle, and these operations ensure the safe operation of the vehicle according to the intelligent vehicle. Finally, the feasibility of the model was verified by comparing different dangerous scenarios. The experimental results show that this risk cognition model can cognize the data of the intelligent vehicle according to different danger scenarios, and the model can transmit acceleration, deceleration, braking, and other behaviors to the intelligent vehicle to ensure smart city driving safety.},

This characteristic makes FL an ideal choice for machine learning using user data while maintaining privacy.

However, the performance of FL in edge computing environments has received limited research attention, and previous studies have not comprehensively evaluated heterogeneity aspects, such as system heterogeneity, statistical heterogeneity, and communication bandwidth. This study aims to fill this research gap by conducting experimental evaluations and detailed analyses of FL in edge computing environments. Specifically, we set up an experimental testbed based on the FL framework on the KubeEdge platform and evaluate the diverse effects of heterogeneity aspects on the model convergence time such as homogeneous versus heterogeneous hardware resources, balanced versus imbalanced data distributions, duplicate versus nonduplicate datasets, client participation ratio at each round, the client selection algorithm, and the communication bandwidth. Overall, this study contributes to the advancement of the field of FL by expanding the understanding of its performance in edge computing environments and providing guidelines for efficient and effective FL systems in heterogeneous environments, which can ultimately benefit various industries and domains.},

   abstract = {The increased mobility requirements of modern lifestyles put more stress on existing traffic infrastructure, which causes reduced traffic flow, especially in peak traffic hours. This calls for new and advanced solutions in traffic flow regulation and management. One approach towards optimisation is a transition from static to dynamic traffic light intervals, especially in spots where pedestrian crossing cause stops in road traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a smart pedestrian traffic light triggering mechanism that uses a Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar for pedestrian detection. Compared to, for example, camera-surveillance systems, radars have advantages in the ability to reliably detect pedestrians in low-visibility conditions and in maintaining privacy. Objects within a radar’s detection range are represented in a point cloud structure, in which pedestrians form clusters where they lose all identifiable features. Pedestrian detection and tracking are completed with a group tracking (GTRACK) algorithm that we modified to run on an external processor and not integrated into the used FMCW radar itself. The proposed prototype has been tested in multiple scenarios, where we focused on removing the call button from a conventional pedestrian traffic light. The prototype responded correctly in practically all cases by triggering the change in traffic signalization only when pedestrians were standing in the pavement area directly in front of the zebra crossing.},

The analysis of a video recorded from a Dash Cam retrieved inside the vehicle during the death scene investigation (DSI) was crucial in the reconstruction of the manner of death. Indeed, the death, which was initially assumed to be accidental, was finally deemed as a suicide on the basis of the video recording, which showed an intentional and sudden rush of the victim to the middle of the roadway. Advantages and disadvantages of the use of Dash Cams will be discussed, focusing on the profound differences in the related national and international regulations. Based on the present case, in traffic crashes, the search for Dash Cams during the DSI may be recommended and the video recordings should be analyzed in the setting of a multidisciplinary and multimodal evaluation of the case, for a proper reconstruction of the facts.},

More concretely, we develop a method to infer the global number of new infections from patchy observations, by coupling ad hoc spatial models for disease transmission via respiratory droplets to detailed field-data about pedestrian trajectories and head orientations. This allows us to rank the investigated situations by the infection risks that they present; importantly, the obtained hierarchy of risks is very largely conserved across transmission models: Street cafés present the largest average rate of new infections caused by an attendant, followed by busy outdoor markets, and then metro and train stations, whereas the risks incurred while walking on fairly busy streets are comparatively quite low. While our models only approximate the actual transmission risks, their converging predictions lend credence to these findings. In situations with a moving crowd, density is the main factor influencing the estimated infection rate. Finally, our study explores the efficiency of street and venue redesigns in mitigating the viral spread: While the benefits of enforcing one-way foot traffic in (wide) walkways are unclear, changing the geometry of queues substantially affects disease transmission risks.},

We consider heterogeneous classes of vehicles such as road and rail vehicles as well as VRUs including bicycles, scooters and motorcycles. All kinds of intersection goals, modeling, coordination architectures, scheduling policies are thoroughly discussed. Signalized and semi-autonomous intersections are assessed with respect to these parameters. We especially focus on autonomous intersection management (AIM) and categorize this section based on four major goals involving safety, efficiency, infotainment and environment. Each intersection goal provides an in-depth investigation on the corresponding literature from the aforementioned perspectives. Moreover, robustness and resiliency of IM are explored from diverse points of view encompassing sensors, information management and sharing, planning universal scheme, heterogeneous collaboration, vehicle classification, quality measurement, external factors, intersection types, localization faults, communication anomalies and channel optimization, synchronization, vehicle dynamics and model mismatch, model uncertainties, recovery, security and privacy.},

   abstract = {Walking is now promoted as an alternative transport mode to polluting cars and as a successful means to improve health and longevity. Intelligent transport systems navigation services are now directly targeting travelers due to smartphones and their embedded sensors. However, after a decade of research, no universal personal navigation system has been successfully introduced and adopted to improve personal mobility. An analysis of the underlying reasons is conducted, looking at the engineering, human, ethical, and legal challenges. First, contrary to adopting classical mechanization equations linked to solid state physics, location technologies must address complex personal dynamics using connected objects. Second, human factors are often not sufficiently considered while designing new technologies. The needs and abilities of travelers are not systematically addressed from a user-centered perspective. Finally, people want to benefit from location-based services without sharing personal location data to uncontrolled third bodies. Europe is a pioneer in the protection of individuals from personal identification through data processing since location data has been recognized as personal data, but the challenges to enforce the regulation are numerous. The recommendation of 'privacy by design and default' is an interesting key to conceive the universal personal navigation solution. Alternative solutions are highlighted, but they definitively require a more interdisciplinary conception.},

The communications among these entities (e.g. vehicles, pedestrians, fleet management systems, and road-side infrastructure) generally take place via an open channel. In other words, such an open communication can be targeted by the adversary to eavesdrop, modify, insert fabricated (or malicious) messages, or delete any data-in-transit; thus, resulting in replay, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, privileged-insider, and other related attacks. In addition to security, anonymity and untraceability are two other important features that should be achieved in an authentication protocol. In this paper, we propose a new mutual authentication and key agreement protocol in an IoV-enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Using both formal and informal security analysis, as well as formal security verification using an automated verification tool, we show that the proposed scheme is secure against several known attacks in an IoV-enabled ITS environment. Furthermore, a detailed comparative analysis shows that the proposed scheme has low communication and computational overheads, and offers better security and functionality attributes in comparison to seven other competing schemes. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using NS2.},

   abstract = {The detection of secure vehicles for content placement in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications makes a challenging situation for a well-organized dynamic nature of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET). With the increase in the demand of efficient and adoptable content delivery, information-centric networking (ICN) can be a promising solution for the future needs of the network. ICN provides a direct retrieval of content through its unique name, which is independent of locations. It also performs better in content retrieval with its in-network caching and named-based routing capabilities. Since vehicles are mobile devices, it is very crucial to select a caching node, which is secure and reliable. The security of data is quite important in the vehicular named data networking (VNDN) environment due to its vital importance in saving the life of drivers and pedestrians. To overcome the issue of security and reduce network load in addition to detect a malicious activity, we define a blockchain-based distributive trust model to achieve security, trust, and privacy of the communicating entities in VNDN, named secure vehicle communication caching (SVC-caching) mechanism for the placement of on-demand data. The proposed trust management mechanism is decentralized in nature, which is used to select a trustworthy node for cluster-based V2V communications in the VNDN environment. The SVC-caching strategy is simulated in the NS-2 simulator. The results are evaluated based on one-hop count, delivery ratio, cache hit ratio, and malicious node detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed technique improves the performance based on the selected parameters.},

   abstract = {The automotive industry is experiencing a transformation with the rapid integration of software-based systems inside vehicles, which are complex systems with multiple sensors. The use of vehicle sensor data has enabled vehicles to communicate with other entities in the connected vehicle ecosystem, such as the cloud, road infrastructure, other vehicles, pedestrians, and smart grids, using either cellular or wireless networks. This vehicle data are distributed, private, and vulnerable, which can compromise the safety and security of vehicles and their passengers. It is therefore necessary to design an access control mechanism around the vehicle data’s unique attributes and distributed nature. Since connected vehicles operate in a highly dynamic environment, it is important to consider context information such as location, time, and frequency when designing a fine-grained access control mechanism. This leads to our research question: How can Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) fulfill connected vehicle requirements of Signal Access Control (SAC), Time-Based Access Control (TBAC), Location-Based Access Control (LBAC), and Frequency-Based Access Control (FBAC)? To address the issue, we propose a data flow model based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) called eXtensible Access Control Markup Language for Mobility (XACML4M). XACML4M adds additional components to the standard eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) to satisfy the identified requirements of SAC, TBAC, LBAC, and FBAC in connected vehicles. Specifically, these are: Vehicle Data Environment (VDE) integrated with Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), Time Extensions, GeoLocation Provider, Polling Frequency Provider, and Access Log Service. We implement a prototype based on these four requirements on a Raspberry Pi 4 and present a proof-of-concept for a real-world use case. We then perform a functional evaluation based on the authorization policies to validate the XACML4M data flow model. Finally, we conclude that our proposed XACML4M data flow model can fulfill all four of our identified requirements for connected vehicles.},

   abstract = {Introduction: This paper describes the development of an architecture for the integration of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), i.e. pedestrians, cyclists and powered two-wheelers (PTWs) in Cooperative ITS (C-ITS) systems, and the requirements for VRU devices. Methods: This paper starts with a literature overview on research related to safety applications using communication between vehicle and VRU, and an analysis of the different use cases for C-ITS for VRUs. An architecture is developed, starting from an architecture of C-ITS systems and incorporating the different alternative configuration for VRUs. Starting from the architecture and the use cases, the requirements for VRU devices are defined. Finally, a roadmap regarding C-ITS applications for VRUs is developed. Results: C-ITS technologies allow to communicate with low latency in highly dynamic environments. C-ITS will be integrated in vehicles and can also become available for VRUs, either as an application on a smartphone or as a dedicated device, which can be integrated in the VRU’s vehicle. Two levels of use cases can be identified: awareness of the presence of VRUs near potentially dangerous situations, and collision risk warning, based on trajectories of the road users. A roadmap was developed aligned with the roadmap of the automotive industry. Conclusions: Awareness related use cases are relatively close to the market, as they do not put stringent requirements to the (localization) sensors at infrastructure or vehicles. For the collision risk warning use case, the technical requirements for VRU devices towards sensor accuracy and calculation capabilities are challenging. Other challenges are power consumption, context sensitivity, channel congestion, privacy and security of messages. Standardisation of the messages exchanged between VRUs and other road users and infrastructure is a key issue.},

   abstract = {Next-generation audio-visual (AV) hearing aids stand as a major enabler to realize more intelligible audio. However, high data rate, low latency, low computational complexity, and privacy are some of the major bottlenecks to the successful deployment of such advanced hearing aids. To address these challenges, we propose an integration of 5G Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN), Internet of Things (IoT), and strong privacy algorithms to fully benefit from the possibilities these technologies have to offer. Existing audio-only hearing aids are known to perform poorly in noisy situations where overwhelming noise is present. Current devices make the signal more audible but remain deficient in restoring intelligibility. Thus, there is a need for hearing aids that can selectively amplify the attended talker or filter out acoustic clutter. The proposed 5G IoT-enabled AV hearing-aid framework transmits the encrypted compressed AV information and receives encrypted enhanced reconstructed speech in real time to address cybersecurity attacks such as location privacy and eavesdropping. For security implementation, a real-time lightweight AV encryption is proposed, based on a piece-wise linear chaotic map (PWLSM), Chebyshev map, and a secure hash and S-Box algorithm. For speech enhancement, the received secure AV (including lip-reading) information in the cloud is used to filter noisy audio using both deep learning and analytical acoustic modelling. To offload the computational complexity and real-time optimization issues, the framework runs deep learning and big data optimization processes in the background, on the cloud. The effectiveness and security of the proposed 5G-IoT-enabled AV hearing-aid framework are extensively evaluated using widely known security metrics. Our newly reported, deep learning-driven lip-reading approach for speech enhancement is evaluated under four different dynamic real-world scenarios (cafe, street, public transport, pedestrian area) using benchmark Grid and ChiME3 corpora. Comparative critical analysis in terms of both speech enhancement and AV encryption demonstrates the potential of the envisioned technology to deliver high-quality speech reconstruction and secure mobile AV hearing aid communication. We believe our proposed 5G IoT enabled AV hearing aid framework is an effective and feasible solution and represents a step change in the development of next-generation multimodal digital hearing aids. The ongoing and future work includes more extensive evaluation and comparison with benchmark lightweight encryption algorithms and hardware prototype implementation.},

   abstract = {Crowd density analysis is a crucial component in visual surveillance mainly for security monitoring. This paper proposes a novel approach for crowd density measure, in which local information at pixel level substitutes a global crowd level or a number of people per-frame. The proposed approach consists of generating automatic crowd density maps using local features as an observation of a probabilistic density function. It also involves a feature tracking step which excludes feature points belonging to the background. This process is favorable for the later density estimation as the influence of features irrelevant to the underlying crowd density is removed. Since the proposed crowd density conveys rich information about the local distributions of persons in the scene, we employ it as a side information to complement other tasks related to video surveillance in crowded scenes. First, since conventional detection and tracking methods are hard to be scalable to crowds, we use the proposed crowd density to enhance detection and tracking in videos of high density crowds. Second, we employ the local density together with regular motion patterns as crowd attributes for high level applications such as crowd change detection and event recognition. Third, we investigate the concept of crowd context-aware privacy protection by adjusting the obfuscation level according to the crowd density. In the experimental results, our proposed approach for crowd density estimation is evaluated on videos from different datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of feature tracks for crowd measurements. Moreover, the employment of crowd density in other applications demonstrate good performances for detection, tracking, behavior analysis, and privacy preservation.},

   abstract = {In online environments (i.e., product review sites in our case), consumers are increasingly interacting and socializing with many “strangers” (i.e., online crowds) as well as sharing personal and product information. Drawing from social norms theory, we examine how the multiple aspects of online crowds affect their self-disclosure behaviors as they provide online reviews and investigate the extent to which prior experience moderates this relationship. Our analysis of data from a leading apparel rental site in the United States uncovers that individuals are inclined to conform to the self-disclosure behaviors of a crowd and divulge more personal information as self-disclosure variance within the group increases. Conversely, individuals are more likely to conceal personal information as a review page becomes crowded. The findings reveal that a reviewer’s prior experience of writing a review on the website weakens conformity behavior and reduces the effects of crowdedness. The prior experience also positively interacts with self-disclosure variance in a crowd. Based on these results, we present theoretical implications to literature on social norms and privacy, prior experience, and online reviews. This study also has managerial implications for firms interested in content generation by online reviewers and in review systems where user-generated content is essential.},

As countries aim to recover their economies, there is an increasing need for smart city solutions, such as crowd monitoring systems, to ensure public safety both during and after the pandemic. This paper presents the design and implementation of a real-time crowd monitoring system using existing public Wi-Fi infrastructure. The proposed system employs a three-tiered architecture, including the sensing domain for data acquisition, the communication domain for data transfer, and the computing domain for data processing, visualization, and analysis. Wi-Fi access points were used as sensors that continuously monitored the crowd and uploaded data to the server. To protect the privacy of the data, encryption algorithms were employed during data transmission. The system was implemented in the Sri Chiang Mai Smart City, where nine Wi-Fi access points were installed in nine different locations along the Mekong River. The system provides real-time crowd density visualizations. Historical data were also collected for the analysis and understanding of urban behaviors. A quantitative evaluation was not feasible due to the uncontrolled environment in public open spaces, but the system was visually evaluated in real-world conditions to assess crowd density, rather than represent the entire population. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of leveraging existing public Wi-Fi infrastructure for crowd monitoring in uncontrolled, real-world environments. The monitoring system is readily accessible and does not require additional hardware investment or maintenance. The collected dataset is also available for download. In addition to COVID-19 pandemic management, this technology can also assist government policymakers in optimizing the use of public space and urban planning. Real-time crowd density data provided by the system can assist route planners or recommend points of interest, while information on the popularity of tourist destinations enables targeted marketing.},

   abstract = {The home of the future will surely be a technologically richer environment, offering tens or even hundreds of network services ranging from the simple continuous transmission of video data streams to a complex system of house energy management. The typical elements within the house that can be controlled are: lighting, windows and shutters, doors, speakers, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, appliances (refrigerator, washing machine, ovens, etc.), audio-video systems, burglar alarms and fire alarms, telecommunications. Many operational control sequences can be automated to prevent the user from making the effort to adapt to systems. Some of these services will be provided by devices inside the home and others by external providers. So a great improvement to this control can happen by adding a certain degree of "intelligence"to the system allowing it to recognize recurring activities, dangerous or unusual situations in order to anticipate health problems or special needs of users within of the House. These problems can be addressed by monitoring the activities of regular users, which allows the creation of rules-based profiles, in order to grasp and formalize their normal behavior. In order to realize Smart Home systems through IoT, the problem of localization within closed spaces remains constant: in fact, efficiency is put to the test by all those that are the vertical closures (opinions and fixtures) with which optimal transmission with the outside is possible. The Beacon technology was used to solve the indoor transmission. The Beacon is a device that through Bluetooth Low Energy technology, is able to transmit information to mobile devices with a certain range of action. In this paper, for the Beacons, different methods of localization in a closed environment are tested and demonstrated through a mapping of the signal in a room, has led to satisfactory results. The relationship between the used beacon and area covered by their own signal is also identified in a beacon every 5 square meters; this result allows us to have an idea of the costs of mapping a given environment and the invasion of the technology inside it. A further raised question of the relationship between used beacon and covered area was how and where to place the beacons inside the room; The less satisfactory result concerns the error, albeit low, detected in the pure localization (ie without the help of external information such as the initial position) in a closed environment.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications typically collect and analyse personal data that can be used to derive sensitive information about individuals. However, thus far, privacy concerns have not been explicitly considered in software engineering processes when designing IoT applications. With the advent of behaviour driven security mechanisms, failing to address privacy concerns in the design of IoT applications can also have security implications. In this paper, we explore how a Privacy-by-Design (PbD) framework, formulated as a set of guidelines, can help software engineers integrate data privacy considerations into the design of IoT applications. We studied the utility of this PbD framework by studying how software engineers use it to design IoT applications. We also explore the challenges in using the set of guidelines to influence the IoT applications design process. In addition to highlighting the benefits of having a PbD framework to make privacy features explicit during the design of IoT applications, our studies also surfaced a number of challenges associated with the approach. A key finding of our research is that the PbD framework significantly increases both novice and expert software engineers’ ability to design privacy into IoT applications.},

   abstract = {The internet of things (IoT) has prepared the way for a highly linked world, in which everything is interconnected, and information exchange has become more easily accessible via the internet, making it feasible for various applications that enrich the quality of human life. Despite such a potential vision, users’ privacy on these IoT devices is a significant concern. IoT devices are subject to threats from hackers and malware due to the explosive expansion of IoT and its use in commerce and critical infrastructures. Malware poses a severe danger to the availability and reliability of IoT devices. If left uncontrolled, it can have profound implications, as IoT devices and smart services can collect personally identifiable information (PII) without the user’s knowledge or consent. These devices often transfer their data into the cloud, where they are stored and processed to provide the end users with specific services. However, many IoT devices do not meet the same security criteria as non-IoT devices; most used schemes do not provide privacy and anonymity to legitimate users. Because there are so many IoT devices, so much malware is produced every day, and IoT nodes have so little CPU power, so antivirus cannot shield these networks from infection. Because of this, establishing a secure and private environment can greatly benefit from having a system for detecting malware in IoT devices. In this paper, we will analyze studies that have used ML as an approach to solve IoT privacy challenges, and also investigate the advantages and drawbacks of leveraging data in ML-based IoT privacy approaches. Our focus is on using ML models for detecting malware in IoT devices, specifically spyware, ransomware, and Trojan horse malware. We propose using ML techniques as a solution for privacy attack detection and test pattern generation in the IoT. The ML model can be trained to predict behavioral architecture. We discuss our experiments and evaluation using the “MalMemAnalysis” datasets, which focus on simulating real-world privacy-related obfuscated malware. We simulate several ML algorithms to prove their capabilities in detecting malicious attacks against privacy. The experimental analysis showcases the high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting obfuscated and concealed malware, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 99.50%, and would be helpful in safeguarding an IoT network from malware. Experimental analysis and results are provided in detail.},

   abstract = {Objective: The Pedestrian Behaviour Scale (PBS) is a self-report questionnaire that distinguishes five dimensions of pedestrian behaviour: violations, errors, lapses, aggressive behaviours and positive behaviours. This study aimed to meet three objectives: to trace the development of the PBS worldwide from 1997 to 2021, to report on its varied uses and to analyse the scientific validation of the different dimensions of pedestrian behaviour reflected by the PBS and its derivatives. Design/methodology: In this systematic literature review, we selected all works that cited the 2013 founding study of the PBS as well as all publications that cited the 2017 US validation of PBS which was frequently replicated around the world. We conducted an online database search using Web of Science, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and PubMed. After excluding duplicates, 116 studies were identified. A total of 30 studies were selected to meet our first two objectives and 14 studies were selected to meet our third objective. Results: Over time, the PBS has undergone many changes. Overall, we found differences in the scientific validation of this questionnaire depending on the version used, the validation tests performed and the population studied. The original version of the PBS and its Turkish adaptation proved most appropriate for assessing the transgressions dimension. The American version of the PBS proved a suitable alternative but it is more suited to assessing the two independent dimensions of violations and errors. The Chinese version of the PBS (CPBS) proved unsuitable for assessing the lapses dimension, while the original version of the PBS emerged as the best option for assessing aggressive behaviours. The positive behaviour dimension presented many validation difficulties but its assessment by the CPBS seems to be the most appropriate option. Conclusion: As no systematic review of the PBS has been conducted before, researchers can now make an informed choice of methodology quickly and be guided by our recommendations regarding the use and possible improvements of the different validated versions.},

A stratified sample of drivers (N = 881) was surveyed with a questionnaire constructed to measure attitudes toward behaviors, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intentions, the key constructs in TPB. Results showed that the addition of perceived behavioral control led to significant increments in the amount of explained variance in intentions, thereby supporting the theory. The relation between subjective norms and behavioral intentions was consistently stronger than that between attitudes toward behaviors and behavioral intentions. Analyses of variance differentiated demographic subgroups of drivers in terms of behavioral beliefs, outcome evaluations, normative beliefs, motivation to comply, and control beliefs.},

Beside giving access to the train platforms (it passes underneath the railways), the walkway plays an important connection role in the city. Several crowding scenarios occur during the day, including high- and low-density dynamics in uni- and bi-directional regimes. In this paper we discuss our recording technique and we illustrate preliminary data analyses. Via fundamental diagrams-like representations we report pedestrian velocities and fluxes vs. pedestrian density. Considering the density range $0$ - $1.1\,$ped/m$^2$, we find that at densities lower than $0.8\,$ped/m$^2$ pedestrians in unidirectional flows walk faster than in bidirectional regimes. On the opposite, velocities and fluxes for even bidirectional flows are higher above $0.8\,$ped/m$^2$.},

   abstract = {Crowd monitoring systems are more and more used to support crowd management organizations. Currently, counting systems are often used to provide quantitative insights into the pedestrian traffic state, since they are fairly easy to install and the accuracy is reasonably good under normal conditions. However, there are no sensor systems that are 100% accurate. Detection errors might have severe consequences for the density state estimation at large squares. The consequences of these errors for pedestrian state estimation have not yet been determined. This paper studies the impact of one specific type of detection error on the functionality of counting camera systems for density state estimation, namely, a randomly occurring "false negative" detection error. The impact is determined via two tracks, a theoretical track and a simulation track. The latter track studies the distribution of the cumulative number of pedestrians after 24 hours for three stylized cases by means of Monte Carlo simulations. This paper finds that counting camera systems, which have a detection error that is not correlated with the flow rate, provide a reasonably good estimation of the density within an area. At the same time, if the detection error is correlated with the flow rate, counting camera systems should only be used in the situation where symmetric demand patterns are expected.},

Our case study is the Galleria Borghese museum in Rome (Italy), in which we performed a real-life data acquisition campaign. We specifically employ a Lagrangian IoT-based visitor tracking system based on Raspberry Pi receivers, displaced in fixed positions throughout the museum rooms, and on portable Bluetooth Low Energy beacons handed over to the visitors. Thanks to two algorithms: a sliding window-based statistical analysis and an MLP neural network, we filter the beacons RSSI and accurately reconstruct visitor trajectories at room-scale. Via a clustering analysis, hinged on an original Wasserstein-like trajectory-space metric, we analyze the visitors paths to get behavioral insights, including the most common flow patterns. On these bases, we build the transition matrix describing, in probability, the room-scale visitor flows. Such a matrix is the cornerstone of a stochastic model capable of generating visitor trajectories in silico. We conclude by employing the simulator to enhance the museum fruition while respecting numerous logistic and safety constraints. This is possible thanks to optimized ticketing and new entrance/exit management.},

   abstract = {In the Netherlands, rail passenger transport has grown considerably during the last decades. Although growth has been seen nationwide, it has concentrated at a few of the largest stations in the country (e.g. Amsterdam Central and Utrecht Central station). As a result, these stations are being redeveloped. Furthermore, this growth trend is expected to continue into the future. This also means that (temporary) overcrowding can arise at these stations. These trends have triggered a need for more insights into the behaviour of passengers inside train stations. With these insights, existing stations can be better managed, and redevelopments can be better designed and planned. This paper presents quantitative research results regarding the factors that influence route and activity location choice behaviour of departing passengers at train stations. For this study, SMART Station data has been used. This automated data collection system is based on Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and infrared sensors. It generates revealed preference data on passenger routes and activities in train stations. Estimated discrete choice models based on these data show which factors influence the choice of departing passengers for vertical infrastructure facilities (i.e. escalators and stairways; route choice) and the choice of retail outlets in the station building (activity location choice). The factors significantly influencing route choice behaviour of departing passengers are: travel time, walking distance, train stop location alongside the platform and right side orientation of the vertical infrastructure facility which provides access to the platforms. Travel time and walking distance appeared to be highly correlated. To get a better model fit, only the first has been included in the final model, together with train stop location and orientation. Travel time is the most important factor. In the activity location choice model, also four factors turned out to be of significant influence: travel time from station entrance to the retail outlet, total distance (from entrance via outlet to the platform), the requirement to make a detour for a shop visit, and right side orientation. Distance is the most important factor in this model. To the best of our knowledge, before this study there has been no empirical, quantitative evidence of the factors which contribute to route and activity location choices inside a train station. Due to the large amount of revealed preference data which has been collected by Bluetooth/Wi-Fi-sensors, this study can be considered as first of its kind in the field of train passenger route and activity choice behaviour in train stations.

   abstract = {In this paper, proximity-based Bluetooth tracking is postulated as an efficient and effective methodology for analysing the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of visitor movements at mass events. A case study of the Ghent Festivities event (1.5 million visitors over 10 days) is described in detail and preliminary results are shown to give an indication of the added value of the methodology for stakeholders of the event. By covering 22 locations in the study area with Bluetooth scanners, we were able to extract 152,487 trajectories generated by 80,828 detected visitors. Apart from generating clear statistics such as visitor counts, the share of returning visitors, and visitor flow maps, the analyses also reveal the complex nature of this event by hinting at the existence of several mutually different visitor profiles. We conclude by arguing why Bluetooth tracking offers significant advantages for tracking mass event visitors with respect to other and more prominent technologies, and outline some of its remaining deficiencies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {To simulate crowds at mass events, realistic movement data of people is required. Despite their limited capacity for approximating real human mobility, synthetic movement models are traditionally used for this purpose. More realistic simulations can be achieved by using real-life movement data, gathered by observing people in the desired context. This paper presents a method for tracking people at mass events without the need for active cooperation by the subjects. The mechanism works by scanning at multiple locations for packets sent out by the Wi-Fi interface on visitors' smartphones, and correlating the data captured at these different locations. The proposed method can be implemented at very low cost on Raspberry Pi computers. This implementation was trialed in two different contexts: a popular music festival and a university campus. The method allows for tracking thousands of people simultaneously, and achieves a higher coverage rate than similar methods for involuntary crowd tracking. Moreover, the coverage rate is expected to increase even further as more people will start using smartphones. The proposed method has many applications in different domains. It also entails privacy implications that must be considered when deploying a similar system. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Monitoring open crowded areas is fundamental for policy makers to set up the proper measures for people security and safety. Different techniques have been developed to tackle this issue. The most relevant approaches, which are currently available to estimate the number of attenders, are based on the size of the area hosting the event, the count of people passing through specific points, and the employment of satellite images. All these techniques roughly estimate static crowds, but they may be limited by different factors such as the availability of satellite images, the cost of dedicated unmanned vehicles, and the capability to set up multiple counting points. In order to fill this gap, a tool to monitor dynamic crowds, based on WiFi positioning, is presented. The tool allows not only to assess the total number of people attending an event, but also to monitor their spatiotemporal distribution. In particular, the impact of the cleaning strategies on both the estimated number of participants and their spatiotemporal distribution is analyzed. The proposed approach is demonstrated using real data collected during the JRC Open Day 2016. From the results, the need of a clear strategy to identify real users in order to avoid misleading results emerges. Moreover, a proper setting of the thresholds used for the identification criteria is required. Such thresholds need to be set according to the dimension of the site, the geography of the WiFi network, and the duration of the event.},

In this work, we introduce and describe mathematical methods based on pedestrian-behavior models to infer and visualize crowd conditions from pedestrians' GPS location traces. We tested our approach during the 2011 Lord Mayors Show in London by deploying a system able to infer and visualize in real-time crowd density, crowd turbulence, crowd velocity and crowd pressure. To collection location updates from festival visitors, a mobile phone app that supplies the user with event-related information and periodically logs the device's location was distributed. We collected around four million location updates from over 800 visitors. The City of London Police consulted the crowd condition visualization to monitor the event. As an evaluation of the usefulness of our approach, we learned through interviews with police officers that our approach helps to assess occurring crowd conditions and to spot critical situations faster compared to the traditional video-based methods. With that, appropriate measure can be deployed quickly helping to resolve a critical situation at an early stage. © 2012 IEEE.},

Large stations typically have multiple sets of escalators and stairs, and therefore offer a route choice for passengers. In previous research the impact of waiting time and type of vertical infrastructure on pedestrian route choice behaviour have been identified, and to a limited extent quantified. This paper presents the results of a study of route choice behavior at congested stairs and escalators at Utrecht Central Station in The Netherlands. For data collection, Bluetooth scanunits have been used to measure route choice and waiting time at stairs and escalators. Several route choice models have been estimated to describe the probability of choosing a congested escalator route over alternative uncongested stairway routes. It is found that the preference of escalators over stairways is statistically significant for pedestrian route choice. Moreover, waiting time due to congestion upstream of escalators has a measurable impact on pedestrian route choice. These insights are valuable when improving design and operations of train stations.},

The first direct measurement of travel time was based upon license-plate matching techniques in vehicle notes, mechanical devices attached to odometers, or global positioning system (GPS) recording devices. More recently, cell phone and toll tag tracking have been proposed as a mechanism for collecting probe-vehicle link travel times. A variety of statistical techniques have been published that document techniques for estimating sample size or sample proportion necessary for reliably estimating travel time. This article reports on the use of a prototype system to sniff and time-stamp wireless media access control (MAC) addresses at selected sample locations. Because each MAC address is unique, traditional matching algorithms analogous to those used for license plate, cellular, or toll tag tracking can be used to estimate travel time along a freeway or arterial.},

The concept of vehicle identification using Bluetooth signatures for travel time estimation along a section of freeway is explained. Issues related to error analysis, filtering of raw matched data, and accuracy of the resulting ground truth compared with floating car are discussed. Data from loop detectors on several freeway segments are used to approximate and report the average sampling rate of Bluetooth sensors. Results show that the new technology is a promising method for collecting high-quality travel time data that can be used as ground truth for evaluating other sources of travel time and other intelligent transportation system applications.},

Our goal is to investigate which factors can be disregarded and which should be considered in the development of a positioning algorithm. Our results show that technical factors such as device characteristics have smaller impact on the signal than multipath propagation. Moreover, we show that propagation conditions differ in each direction.

The subsystem uses beacon technology for indoor positioning, supporting self-guidance of the car-searching mobile app. This study also designed a local coordinate system to support the identification of the locations of parking spaces and beacon devices. We used Android as the platform to implement the proposed car-searching mobile app, and used Bytereal HiBeacon devices to implement the proposed positioning-assisting subsystem. We also deployed the system in a parking lot in our campus for testing. The experimental results verified that the proposed system not only works well, but also provides the car owner with the correct route guidance information.},

   abstract = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a satellite positioning system. However, when the signal is shielded by reinforced concrete or metal, it is difficult to be received indoors. This study introduces an indoor location estimation scheme based on bluetooth low energy (BLE) for pedestrian navigation that can save power and reduce the installation density. We investigated indoor positioning methods with the use of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in association with two BLE transmitters as the main axis. The error of the single RSSI ranging is more than several tens of meters, and is insufficient for use for pedestrian navigation. However, this error is reduced to a few meters when the proposed simple proportional correction calculation is performed for the estimated distance. The target accuracy required for pedestrian navigation for healthy people is approximately 10 m. This is equivalent to the accuracy of outdoor satellite positioning. For example, given that the size of the Shibuya underground shopping street is approximately 4,676 m2, twenty BLE beacons can cover the entire area. If this technology is established, indoor positioning can become possible within a wider range with a lower cost and lower labor effort compared with the current state-of-the-art.},

   abstract = {Over the last decades, researchers have invented many positioning algorithms for pedestrians in the indoor environment, such as trilateration, fingerprint, and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) system. However, indoor positioning is still difficult to solve with current technology. The fingerprint and trilateration based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) usually require filters to stabilize the RSSI signal, which will cause a delay in positioning, which is fatal for real-time positioning. The PDR system with the inertial measurement unit (IMU) of smartphones usually requires the direction of the Y -axis of smartphones parallel with movement. Nevertheless, pedestrians will swing their arms while walking normally, which is not considered in the traditional PDR. In this case, a huge bias in heading estimation is inevitable, which causes the traditional PDR system to be unavailable during walking with swinging arms. In this article, a hybrid indoor positioning algorithm based on IMU and RSSI is proposed for pedestrians with swinging arms. The PDR system is improved by analyzing the characteristics of walking postures. In order to eliminate the cumulative error existing in the traditional PDR system, we propose the multipoint positioning algorithm based on RSSI for calibration.

   abstract = {Wi-Fi-based localization using received signal strength (RSS) with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm is widely used to track pedestrians in indoor environments. However, the unsatisfactory deployment of Wi-Fi access points (APs) in buildings and the unstable performance of PDR are still key problems that lead to low localization accuracy. In this paper, we make contributions on proposing a hybrid Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) indoor localization system (ILS) based on an efficient BLE deployment strategy and hierarchical topological fingerprinting (HTF). For the BLE deployment strategy, we deploy BLE beacons in places that do not have clear Wi-Fi signals for localization. This efficiently increases the localization accuracy. For HTF, we hierarchically localize targets based on a topological fingerprint (TF) map. First of all, we quickly localize the room in which the target is located by Dendogram-based support vector machine (DSVM). Then, the specific position of the target is estimated by fusing Wi-Fi and BLE signals with the TF map. The new BLE-based fingerprinting algorithm is used to localize targets in environments sparsely populated by BLE beacons. We conduct physical experiments in a real building. The experimental results demonstrate that the beacons deployed based on our proposed deployment strategy results in greater localization accuracy. Furthermore, the HTF approach performs better than the other commonly used localization methods.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, smartphones have become indispensable in people’s daily work and life. Since various sensors and communication chips have been integrated into smartphones, it has become feasible to provide indoor positioning using phones. This paper proposes such a solution based on a smartphone, combining Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) in the particle filter framework to realize real-time and reliable indoor positioning. First, the smartphone’s built-in accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope are used to provide data measurements and formulate a feasible method for PDR. Second, a range-free weighted centroid algorithm is proposed to realize BLE-based localization with low computation complexity. However, a single positioning technology has limitations, e.g., the cumulative error of PDR and the received signal strength fluctuation of BLE. Finally, to exploit the complementary strengths of each technology, a fusion framework utilizing a particle filter is proposed to combine PDR and BLE-based methods and provides more stable and accurate positioning results. Experiments are conducted on a floor in a campus building. Experimental results show that our proposed fused positioning method offers more accurate and stable performance in the long run compared with single PDR or BLE-based positioning. The achieved average positioning error is 1.34 m, which is reduced by 24.16% compared with PDR positioning and 10.60% compared with BLE-based positioning. Moreover, about 95% of the positioning errors are smaller than 1.7 m. The proposed fused positioning method has a vast application prospect in indoor navigation, indoor user tracking, and interactive experience for indoor visitors.},

An estimated 6, 704 American pedestrians died and over 200, 000 pedestrians were injured in traffic crashes in 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [1]. This number is increasing annually and many researchers posit that distraction by smartphones is a primary reason for the increasing number of pedestrian injuries and deaths. One strategy to prevent pedestrian injuries and death is to use intrusive interruptions that warn distracted pedestrians directly on their smartphones. To this end, we developed StreetBit, a Bluetooth beacon-based mobile application that alerts distracted pedestrians with a visual and/or audio interruption when they are distracted by their smartphones and are approaching a potentially-dangerous traffic intersection. In this paper, we present the background, architecture, and operations of the StreetBit Application.},

In this paper, we propose a method for sensing street-level crowd density with good accuracy by observing public Bluetooth low energy (BLE) advertisements from popular contact tracing applications. We conducted an experiment in major shopping districts in Tokyo by deploying our developed sensing devices and demonstrated that our method can estimate the street-level crowd density in 30-min intervals with high accuracy, compared to manually counting the number of pedestrians. Using this method, we have begun to publish the street-level crowd density on our website and a news program on Japanese television. Moreover, through long-term monitoring of the collected street-level crowd density data, we analyzed the factors that affect crowd density and constructed a model to predict crowd density from other factors with a coefficient of determination of 0.9 or higher using support vector regression.},

Its potential, however, remains largely unexplored for understanding pedestrian behaviour. This study focuses on investigating the potential of BLE in identifying pedestrian activity in an outdoor linear walkway. We specifically examine the likelihood of detecting pauses in the movement of pedestrians on a linear walkway using the strength of the signals obtained from a BLE device carried by the pedestrian. To accomplish this, a volunteer pedestrian intentionally pauses at selected points on the chosen walkway for varying predetermined intervals. The obtained data was conditioned using a polynomial curve to reduce the impact of anomalous data and was subsequently used to detect flatness in the trend of the signals to identify a pause. This flatness was identified using a sliding window standard deviation (SD) calculation over the curve obtained through polynomial fitting. Our results indicate a strong likelihood of detecting long pauses in a pedestrian's journey.},

It is important to develop an understanding of the effectiveness of these contemporary designs. In the age of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), there is a need to develop technology-based solutions that collect information about the behaviour of pedestrians as they commute and engage in leisure pursuits while preserving the privacy of citizens. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), has privacy preserving features that make it suitable for studies of this type. This work presents preliminary results of a detailed multi-stakeholder study that collected information via BLE from 27 volunteer pedestrians who regularly used the public domain of the newly developed Grangegorman campus in Dublin's north inner city. Before commencement of data collection, each volunteer completed a short questionnaire about their intended movements in the campus, and for the next three weeks they each carried a small keyring-sized BLE beacon with them as they passed through the campus. Bluetooth received signal strength was collected at 17 points around the campus over the study period. The data for the volunteers was anonymised at its point of capture using hash encoding of the MAC address of the carried beacons. The results of the work show that BLE can be used to monitor the approximate movements of volunteer pedestrians and so provide valuable information on the utilisation of public infrastructure.},

We first draw on the Arendtian concept of a mask to interpret Glass as a mask collector and narrator in the public space. We proceed to the empirical study, where we examine how people talk about the (anticipated) use of Glass on social network sites, such as YouTube. The study shows that control of information is but one of multiple understandings of privacy that people enact in relation to Google Glass. In the concluding part, we argue for an increased responsibility of Glass users to be aware of and preserve the multiple dimensions of the value of privacy, and thus safeguard the presence of plurality in the public space.},

   abstract = {The design of pedestrian-friendly infrastructures plays a crucial role in creating sustainable transportation in urban environments. Analyzing pedestrian behaviour in response to existing infrastructure is pivotal to planning, maintaining, and creating more pedestrian-friendly facilities. Many approaches have been proposed to extract such behaviour by applying deep learning models to video data. Video data, however, includes an broad spectrum of privacy-sensitive information about individuals, such as their location at a given time or who they are with. Most of the existing models use privacy-invasive methodologies to track, detect, and analyse individual or group pedestrian behaviour patterns. As a step towards privacy-preserving pedestrian analysis, this paper introduces a framework to anonymize all pedestrians before analyzing their behaviors. The proposed framework leverages recent developments in 3D wireframe reconstruction and digital in-painting to represent pedestrians with quantitative wireframes by removing their images while preserving pose, shape, and background scene context. To evaluate the proposed framework, a generic metric is introduced for each of privacy and utility. Experimental evaluation on widely-used datasets shows that the proposed framework outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art image filtering approaches by generating best privacy utility trade-off.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a measurement-based analysis of the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals, under Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) scenarios, performed in tandem at two universities in Tampere, Finland, and Bucharest, Romania. We adopted the same hardware and methodology for measurements in both places, and paid particular attention to the impact of RSS on various environmental factors, such as LOS and NLOS scenarios and interference in 2.4 GHz band. In addition, we considered the receiver orientation and the different frequencies of BLE advertising channels. We show that snapshot RSS measurements typically have high variability, not easily explainable by classical path-loss models. A snapshot recording is defined here as one continuous recording at fixed device locations in a static setup. Our observations also show that aggregated RSS data (i.e., considering several snapshot measurements together) is more informative from a statistical point of view and more in agreement with current theoretical path-loss models than snapshot measurements. However, in BLE applications such as contact tracing and proximity detection, the receivers typically have access only to snapshot measurements (e.g., taken over a short duration of 10-20 minutes or less), so the accuracy of contact-Tracing and proximity detection can be highly affected by RSS instabilities. In addition to presenting the measurement-based BLE RSS analysis in a comprehensive and well-documented format, our paper also emphasizes open challenges when BLE RSS is used for contact tracing, ranging, and positioning applications.},

   abstract = {An aging population is bringing new challenges to the management of escape routes and facility design in many countries. This paper investigates pedestrian movement properties of crowd with different age compositions. Three pedestrian groups are considered: young student group, old people group, and mixed group. It is found that traffic jams occur more frequently in mixed group due to the great differences of mobilities and self-adaptive abilities among pedestrians. The jams propagate backward with a velocity 0.4 m/s for global density ρ g ≈ 1.75 m −1 and 0.3 m/s for ρ g > 2.3 m −1. The fundamental diagrams of the three groups are obviously different from each other and cannot be unified into one diagram by direct nondimensionalization. Unlike previous studies, three linear regimes in mixed group but only two regimes in young student group are observed in the headway-velocity relation, which is also verified in the fundamental diagram. Different ages and mobilities of pedestrians in a crowd cause the heterogeneity of system and influence the properties of pedestrian dynamics significantly. It indicates that the density is not the only factor leading to jams in pedestrian traffic. The composition of crowd has to be considered in understanding pedestrian dynamics and facility design.},

@article{Moussaid2012,
   abstract = {In human crowds as well as in many animal societies, local interactions among individuals often give rise to self-organized collective organizations that offer functional benefits to the group. For instance, flows of pedestrians moving in opposite directions spontaneously segregate into lanes of uniform walking directions. This phenomenon is often referred to as a smart collective pattern, as it increases the traffic efficiency with no need of external control. However, the functional benefits of this emergent organization have never been experimentally measured, and the underlying behavioral mechanisms are poorly understood. In this work, we have studied this phenomenon under controlled laboratory conditions. We found that the traffic segregation exhibits structural instabilities characterized by the alternation of organized and disorganized states, where the lifetime of well-organized clusters of pedestrians follow a stretched exponential relaxation process. Further analysis show that the inter-pedestrian variability of comfortable walking speeds is a key variable at the origin of the observed traffic perturbations. We show that the collective benefit of the emerging pattern is maximized when all pedestrians walk at the average speed of the group. In practice, however, local interactions between slow- and fast-walking pedestrians trigger global breakdowns of organization, which reduce the collective and the individual payoff provided by the traffic segregation. This work is a step ahead toward the understanding of traffic self-organization in crowds, which turns out to be modulated by complex behavioral mechanisms that do not always maximize the group's benefits. The quantitative understanding of crowd behaviors opens the way for designing bottom-up management strategies bound to promote the emergence of efficient collective behaviors in crowds.},

   abstract = {Pedestrian facilities have been regarded in urban street design as “leftover spaces” for years, but, currently, there is a growing interest in walking and improving the quality of street environments. Designing pedestrian facilities presents the challenge of simultaneously accommodating (1) pedestrians who want to move safely and comfortably from point A to B (movement function); as well as (2) users who wish to rest, communicate, shop, eat, and enjoy life in a pleasant environment (place function). The aims of this study are to provide an overview of how the task of designing pedestrian facilities is addressed in international guidance material for urban street design, to compare this with scientific evidence on determinants of pedestrian activities, and to finally develop recommendations for advancing provisions for pedestrians. The results show that urban street design guidance is well advanced in measuring space requirements for known volumes of moving pedestrians, but less in planning pleasant street environments that encourage pedestrian movement and place activities. A stronger linkage to scientific evidence could improve guidance materials and better support urban street designers in their ambition to provide safe, comfortable and attractive street spaces that invite people to walk and to stay.},

   abstract = {Urban geometry plays a critical role in determining paths for pedestrian flow in urban areas. To improve the urban planning processes and to enhance quality of life for end-users in urban spaces, a better understanding of the factors influencing pedestrian movement is required by decision-makers within the urban design and planning industry. The aim of this study is to present a novel means to assess pedestrian routing in urban environments. As a unique contribution to knowledge and practice, this study: (a) enhances the body of knowledge by developing a conceptual model to assess and classify pedestrian movement behaviours, utilising machine learning algorithms and location data in conjunction with spatial attributes, and (b) extends previous research by revealing spatial visibility as a driver for pedestrian movement in urban environments. The importance of the findings lies in the perspective of revealing novel insights concerning individual preferences and behaviours of end-users and the utilisation of urban spaces. The approaches developed can be utilised for observations in large-scale contexts, as an addition to traditional methods. Application of the model in a high pedestrian traffic-dense retail urban area in London reveals clear and consistent relationships amongst spatial visibility, individuals’ motivation, and knowledge of the area. Key behaviours established in the study area are grouped into two activity categories: (i) Utilitarian walking (with motivation - expert and novice striders) and (ii) Leisure walking (no motivation - expert and novice strollers). The approach offers an insightful and automated means to understand pedestrian flow in urban contexts and informs wider wayfinding, walkability, and transportation knowledge.},

   abstract = {Previous research has reported that greenery is an important factor in walking activities, with greenery existing in various forms, including trees, gardens, green walls, and other examples. However, traditional methods of measuring urban greenery involve limitations in coverage of various forms of greenery and do not reflect the actual degree of exposure to pedestrians. Accordingly, this study examined the street Green View Index (GVI) and its associations with walking activities by different income groups using survey data on walking behaviors in 2350 residents in Seoul, Korea. This study utilized Google Street View (GSV) and deep learning to calculate the GVI by semantic segmentation, referring to greenness from the visual perspective of pedestrians. Correlation analyses between traditional greenery variables and GVI were conducted to examine differences, and multiple regression models were applied to identify the relationships between walking time and greenery variables. The results of this study show differences between conventional greenery variables and GVI in terms of specific greenery forms and perspectives. As hypothesized, GVI was more closely associated with walking time than the traditional greenery variables. Also, this study found that the low-income residents generally lived in low GVI neighborhood, but walking time is more sensitive to GVI. These results were because GVI represents the actual greenery exposure to pedestrians, and there was a difference between income groups in the degree of vehicle usage in daily life. The results of this study indicate that, when analyzing the relationship between urban greenness and walking behavior, it is necessary to examine the relationship from multiple angles and to investigate the importance of eye-level street greenery. Our findings provide useful insights for public policies to promote pedestrian walking environments.},

Adopting an automated pedestrian counting method, we documented and observed people walking on city streets and found that unique pedestrian traffic patterns reflect land use, development intensity, and neighborhood characteristics. We observed a threshold of thermal comfort in outdoor activities. People tend to seek shade and avoid solar radiation stronger than 1248 Wh/m2 at an average air temperature of 25 °C. Automated collection of detailed pedestrian count data provides a new opportunity for urban designers and transportation planners to understand how people walk and to improve our cities to be less dependent on the automobile.},

   abstract = {Complex movement patterns of pedestrian traffic, ranging from unidirectional to multidirectional flows, are frequently observed in major public infrastructure such as transport hubs. These multidirectional movements can result in increased number of conflicts, thereby influencing the mobility and safety of pedestrian facilities. Therefore, empirical data collection on pedestrians' complex movement has been on the rise in the past two decades. Although there are several reviews of mathematical simulation models for pedestrian traffic in the existing literature, a detailed review examining the challenges and opportunities on empirical studies on the pedestrians complex movements is limited in the literature. The overall aim of this study is to present a systematic review on the empirical data collection for uni- and multidirectional crowd complex movements. We first categorized the complex movements of pedestrian crowd into two general categories, namely, external governed movements and internal driven movements based on the interactions with the infrastructure and among pedestrians, respectively. Further, considering the hierarchy of movement complexity, we decomposed the externally governed movements of pedestrian traffic into several unique movement patterns including straight line, turning, egress and ingress, opposing, weaving, merging, diverging, and random flows. Analysis of the literature showed that empirical data were highly rich in straight line and egress flow while medium rich in turning, merging, weaving, and opposing flows, but poor in ingress, diverging, and random flows. We put emphasis on the need for the future global collaborative efforts on data sharing for the complex crowd movements.},

   abstract = {The empirical relation between density and velocity of pedestrian movement has not been completely analysed, particularly with regard to the 'microscopic' causes which determine the relation at medium and high densities. The simplest system for the investigation of this dependence is the normal movement of pedestrians along a line (single-file movement). This paper presents experimental results for this system under laboratory conditions and discusses the following observations: the data show a linear relation between the velocity and the inverse of the density, which can be regarded as the required length for one pedestrian to move. Furthermore, we compare the results for the single-file movement with literature data for the movement in a plane. This comparison shows an unexpected conformance between the fundamental diagrams, indicating that lateral interference has negligible influence on the velocity-density relation in the density domain 1 m-2 > ρ > 5 m-2. In addition, we test a procedure for automatic recording of pedestrian flow characteristics. We present preliminary results on the measurement range and accuracy of this method. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for studying pedestrians' behavior at pedestrian crossings. To help understand the behavior of pedestrians, separate models were developed and estimated for divided and undivided streets. Estimated models include waiting time at the curbside and the number of crossing attempts needed by the pedestrian to make a successful crossing. From a broad range of road user and roadway factors, the strongest and most significant predictors which influenced the pedestrian's waiting time and the frequency of attempts to cross the streets were gender, age, number of children in household, crossing frequency, number of people in the group attempting to cross, access to private vehicle, destination, home location in relation to pedestrian crossing, and pedestrian past involvement in traffic accidents. In addition to these predictors, maximum likelihood estimates revealed that the pedestrian expected waiting time seems to profoundly influence the number of attempts needed to successfully cross the street (divided or undivided). Furthermore, results relating to pedestrian crossings on divided streets indicate that the pedestrian's expected waiting time when crossing from one side of the street to the central refuge island seem to increase the risk to end the waiting time when crossing from the refuge island to the other side of the street. Finally, results seem to suggest that pedestrians behave differently or have different waiting times as they cross from one side of the street to the refuge and from the refuge to the other side of the street.

To make it a reality, autonomous vehicles require the ability to communicate with other road users and understand their intentions. Such interactions are essential between vehicles and pedestrians, the most vulnerable road users. Understanding pedestrian behavior, however, is not intuitive and depends on various factors, such as demographics of the pedestrians, traffic dynamics, environmental conditions, and so on. In this paper, we identify these factors by surveying pedestrian behavior studies, both the classical works on pedestrian-driver interaction and the modern ones that involve autonomous vehicles. To this end, we will discuss various methods of studying pedestrian behavior and analyze how the factors identified in the literature are interrelated. We will also review the practical applications aimed at solving the interaction problem, including design approaches for autonomous vehicles that communicate with pedestrians and visual perception and reasoning algorithms tailored to understanding pedestrian intention. Based on our findings, we will discuss the open problems and propose future research directions.},

The evaluation of the planned behavior model using EQS showed a significant fit (v 2 ð11Þ ¼ 16:04 p ¼ 0:14; normal fit index ¼ 0:937). The reported violations, errors and lapses appears causally related to the intention to violate regulations , and this in turn with positive attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. Young people have a more positive attitude towards committing violations as pedestrians than adults and perceive the subjective norm to be less inhibitory, have less control over violations, have a more positive intention to commit violations, and report more violations, errors, and lapses than adults. Men report more frequent violations of the traffic rules than women do. The conclusion is drawn that pedestrians, and in particular young males, are at least in part responsible for the high accident rates and remedial actions are suggested.},

Established leaders in the field are the SIFT and SURF algorithms which exhibit great performance under a variety of image transformations, with SURF in particular considered as the most computationally efficient amongst the high-performance methods to date. In this paper we propose BRISK 1, a novel method for keypoint detection, description and matching. A comprehensive evaluation on benchmark datasets reveals BRISK's adaptive, high quality performance as in state-of-the-art algorithms, albeit at a dramatically lower computational cost (an order of magnitude faster than SURF in cases). The key to speed lies in the application of a novel scale-space FAST-based detector in combination with the assembly of a bit-string descriptor from intensity comparisons retrieved by dedicated sampling of each keypoint neighborhood. © 2011 IEEE.},

This paper describes a behavioral experiment in an immersive virtual reality, where individuals are exposed to visual stimuli and their route decisions are recorded. To evaluate the effect of urban visibility on the pedestrian route choices, we introduce visibility scores, such as a graph theoretical centrality measure, to represent the urban environment. Participants in the experiment select routes and the chains of their navigational decisions are then associated with the visibility scores. The selected routes in the virtual reality are compared with all possible routes, which are generated by computational random walk simulations. Statistical analysis suggests that pedestrian navigation choices are purposive and that they are influenced by the specific visibility attributes of the urban environment. Therefore, the research contributes toward development of a unified framework that incorporates the interaction of urban morphology and human spatial behavior. In addition, our experimental procedure and our results highlight the potential of a virtual reality laboratory as a research environment for complex urban situations.},

   abstract = {In this study, virtual reality was the tool used to construct an experimental space. Three scenarios - one without emergency signs, another with an old-version emergency sign, and the third with a new-version emergency sign - were created, after which 107 subjects, divided into three groups, engaged in an emergency escape game to determine if and how various emergency signs aid in way-finding in the event of an emergency. Under the presupposition that the minimum time needed for an emergency escape without any mistake occurring was 40 s, we found that the average way-finding time in the scenario without any emergency signs was 123.8 s, for the scenario with the new-version signs 84.8 s, and for the scenario with the old-version signs 75.6 s; statistically, this demonstrated that the absence of signs results in slower escape than either old signs (p = 0.001) or new signs (p = 0.005). These findings indicate that signs do help way-finding greatly. Males were found to exhibit better way-finding skills than females (p < 0.001). Construction workers and fire safety personnel, as a combined group, did not fare better than others with less presumed prior experience with building plans or emergency exit procedures. In addition, when faced with both an emergency direction sign and an exit door, almost half of the subjects (42% of the participants) were chosen to take the door instead of following the direction posted on the sign. Finally, we found that, at T-intersections, the majority of participants (60%) chose to turn left versus right. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

This chapter discusses how high-level and link budget requirements can be derived and how they can be translated into low-level requirements and eventually into realizable system-design parameters. An ideal SDR offers a highly flexible and versatile platform that permits the instantiation of a variety of different waveforms with widely varying specifications. More precisely, the radio must be capable of transmitting and receiving over a wide frequency range, at various power levels and bandwidths, using different modulation and multiple access schemes. The radio must also be capable of supporting various applications ranging, for example, from simple landing aid waveforms and secure voice communication to advanced data messaging or multimedia application over ad-hoc networks. This versatility imposes on the SDR multiple sets of requirements that must be met all in one platform. This chapter later discusses high-level requirements and how they interrelate to one another and also discusses link budget analysis. Finally, the sensitivity equation that determines the required noise figure of the receiver for a given CNR is explained in detail.}

Section 8.1 presents the measurement campaigns and the related statistical analysis to obtain various channel models for wearable and implantable devices. In addition, the importance of physical human-body phantoms used for channel, Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), and Electromagnetic (EM) exposure measurements are examined. Methodologies to improve the accuracy of these phantoms for various frequency bands are also discussed. Section 8.2 outlines methodologies to improve the medium access control (MAC) and networking layers of a body area networks along with possible architectures for remote health monitoring. Several applications such as localization, activity recognition, and crowdsensing and their corresponding technical challenges are also presented in this section. Finally, Section 8.3 introduces the concept of nanocommunications which can be considered as the nano-scale limit of the IoT technology spectrum. It provides an overview of the promising mechanisms that can establish data communication at molecular levels inside the human body as well as various interfacing techniques with macro-scale devices. It also highlights the revolutionary healthcare applications that could be enabled by this technology.}

The concepts are illustrated using many examples from real wireless systems such as GSM, IS-95 (CDMA), IS-856 (1 x EV-DO), Flash OFDM and UWB (ultra-wideband). Particular emphasis is placed on the interplay between concepts and their implementation in real systems. An abundant supply of exercises and figures reinforce the material in the text. This book is intended for use on graduate courses in electrical and computer engineering and will also be of great interest to practising engineers.},

   abstract = {Indoor localization has recently witnessed an increase in interest, due to the potential wide range of services it can provide by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT), and ubiquitous connectivity. Different techniques, wireless technologies and mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to provide indoor localization services in order to improve the services provided to the users. However, there is a lack of an up-to-date survey paper that incorporates some of the recently proposed accurate and reliable localization systems. In this paper, we aim to provide a detailed survey of different indoor localization techniques such as Angle of Arrival (AoA), Time of Flight (ToF), Return Time of Flight (RTOF), Received Signal Strength (RSS); based on technologies such as WiFi, Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID), Ultra Wideband (UWB), Bluetooth and systems that have been proposed in the literature. The paper primarily discusses localization and positioning of human users and their devices. We highlight the strengths of the existing systems proposed in the literature. In contrast with the existing surveys, we also evaluate different systems from the perspective of energy efficiency, availability, cost, reception range, latency, scalability and tracking accuracy. Rather than comparing the technologies or techniques, we compare the localization systems and summarize their working principle. We also discuss remaining challenges to accurate indoor localization.},

 abstract = {Today, personal information is captured, processed, and disseminated in a bewildering variety of ways, and through increasingly sophisticated, miniaturized, and distributed technologies: identity cards, biometrics, video surveillance, the use of cookies and spyware by Web sites, data mining and profiling, and many others. In The Privacy Advocates, Colin Bennett analyzes the people and groups around the world who have risen to challenge the most intrusive surveillance practices by both government and corporations. Bennett describes a network of self-identified privacy advocates who have emerged from civil society--without official sanction and with few resources, but surprisingly influential. A number of high-profile conflicts in recent years have brought this international advocacy movement more sharply into focus. Bennett is the first to examine privacy and surveillance not from a legal, political, or technical perspective but from the viewpoint of these independent activists who have found creative ways to affect policy and practice. Drawing on extensive interviews with key informants in the movement, he examines how they frame the issue and how they organize, who they are and what strategies they use. He also presents a series of case studies that illustrate how effective their efforts have been, including conflicts over key-escrow encryption (which allows the government to read encrypted messages), online advertising through third-party cookies that track users across different Web sites, and online authentication mechanisms such as the short-lived Microsoft Passport. Finally, Bennett considers how the loose coalitions of the privacy network could develop into a more cohesive international social movement.},

   abstract = {Analyzing pedestrian dynamics has since long been an active and practical field of interest. Since the introduction of, in particular, smartphones, various organizations saw a simple means for automatically measuring pedestrian dynamics. The basic idea is simple: network packets sent by WiFi-enabled devices can be collected by sensors and by extracting the unique MAC address from each packet, it should be possible to count how many devices are detected by a single sensor, as well as how devices move between sensors. Although this approach has been commercially deployed for many years, it is now largely forbidden (at least in the EU) due to obvious privacy infringements. In this paper, we address challenges and some potential solutions to automated measurement of pedestrian movements while protecting privacy. The results come from learning the hard way: having run experiments extensively over the past years, we have gradually gained considerable insight in what is possible and what may lie ahead.},

   abstract = {Probe requests are management frames emitted by devices that perform active scanning to connect to Access Points nearby. These messages can be captured and analysed to implement device counting algorithms. However, using random MAC addresses to protect users’ privacy challenges these algorithms, which must then perform address de-randomization (i.e., cluster the frames with the same source device by analysing valuable features). Datasets of labelled probe requests are needed to develop efficient de-randomization algorithms. Our dataset contains 20 min duration captures collected both in isolated and in "noisy" environments. Twenty-two different devices produced data in six different modes, including settings based on display status, Wi-Fi connection, and power saving. For each mode, we considered three channels contemporaneously for a total of 315 non-empty files. A Raspberry Pi captured the messages through a sniffing algorithm specifically designed to generate this dataset. We then filtered the data by deleting the messages from known sources and using power thresholds that exploit the burst structure of the probe requests. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other available datasets with labelled probe requests. This kind of dataset allows a more accurate analysis of the behaviour of individual devices in different modes and the training and test of algorithms for counting the number of devices through probe requests in the presence of random MAC addresses.},

In most cases, the localization systems use RSS at short range where the distance estimates are more reliable or use RSS alongside other techniques such as Time of Flight (ToF). This is so, since RSSI measurements have relatively high variance at long range and are strongly influenced by occlusions and interference in the deployment region of the Radio Frequency (RF) devices. This paper presents an overview of common filtering techniques that can be used to process RSSI readings in order to improve the accuracy of range computation from raw RSSI with minimal computational overhead. The range estimates computed from the filtered data are compared with expected values of the perturbed range/distance expressed in terms of the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for RSS distance estimation. Results show that filtering can significantly improve the accuracy of range estimation, highlighting the pros and cons of the presented filtering methods at different range values.},

   abstract = {One of the prime challenges in indoor positioning is to determine the location of users inside the building. Many technologies have been used for indoor positioning system but requirement is low cost, energy efficient and stable technology. To fulfil this requirement, Bluetooth low energy(BLE) tags are used due to its low cost and energy efficiency for positioning of user in the indoor building. Our approach is deployment of BLE tags on the ceiling of rooms and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of tags is calculated. When any smart phone enters within the range of BLE tags which are already deployed in the rooms, the tag with high received signal strength will be nominated and information of that tag along with the information of user will be uploaded to the Web server. And user can see its own location from his smart phone. In this way, it's easy to locate the user inside the building. This method is easy to implement due to its low complexity. In this paper, the department of Telecommunication MUET Jamshoro is used as case study and tracked the working staff within the department.},

Recently, several works have analyzed the topic of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device discovery through analytical or simulation models limited to version 4.x. Non-connectable and non-scannable undirected advertising has been shown to be a reliable alternative for discovering a high number of devices in a relatively short time period. However, new features of Bluetooth 5.0 allow us to define a variant on the device discovery process, based on BLE scannable undirected advertising events, which results in higher discovering capacities and also lower power consumption. In order to characterize this new device discovery process, we experimentally model the real device behavior of BLE scannable undirected advertising events. Non-detection packet probability, discovery probability, and discovery latency for a varying number of devices and parameters are compared by simulations and experimental measurements. We demonstrate that our proposal outperforms previous works, diminishing the discovery time and increasing the potential user device density. A mathematical model is also developed in order to easily obtain a measure of the potential capacity in high density scenarios.},

This system will help the user to monitor and manage the security of the house even when the user is outside the house with the help of webpage. This paper presents the design and implementation of a security system using PSoC 4 BLE which can automatically lock and unlock the door when the user in the vicinity and leaving the vicinity of the door respectively by establishing a wireless connection between the physical lock and the smartphone. The system also captures an image of a person arriving at the house and transmits it wirelessly to a webpage. The system also notifies the user of any intrusion by sending a message and the image of the intruder to the webpage. The user can also access the door remotely on the go from the website.},

Most of them use mobile phones to capture data information. However, these systems are agnostic to a specific business field, do not consider indoor movement, do not take into account the participants' employee or client category, and usually do not assign semantics to the visited locations. In this work, we first developed a low-cost tracking system to detect, collect, process, and store users' movement and presence data in indoor environments. Such an approach takes into consideration the users' category and location semantic. We collected these data in two university buildings used by faculty, staff, and students. We suggest that our work could monitor social distancing in indoor environments due to its human presence detection capability, whenever required, such as for the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Generating tracking data is a necessity for this analysis and requires an appropriate methodology. In this study, the applicability of Bluetooth tracking in an indoor setting is investigated. A wide variety of applications can benefit from indoor Bluetooth tracking. This paper examines the value of the method in a marketing application. A Belgian shopping mall served as a real-life test setting for the methodology. A total of 56 Bluetooth scanners registered 18.943 unique MAC addresses during a 19-day period. The results indicate that Bluetooth tracking is a sound approach for capturing tracking data, which can be used to map and analyse the spatio-temporal behaviour of individuals. The methodology also provides a more efficient and more accurate way of obtaining a variety of relevant metrics in the field of consumer behaviour research. Bluetooth tracking can be implemented as a new and cost effective practice for marketing research, that provides fast and accurate results and insights. We conclude that Bluetooth tracking is a viable approach, but that certain technological and practical aspects need to be considered when applying Bluetooth tracking in new cases.},

This statistic is currently increasing annually and research suggests that distraction by smartphones may be a primary reason for the increasing number of pedestrian injuries and deaths. Timely interruptions may alert inattentive pedestrians and prevent fatalities. To this end, we developed StreetBit, a Bluetooth beacon-based system that warns distracted pedestrians with a visual and/or audible interruption when they approach a potentially dangerous traffic intersection while distracted by their smartphones. We posit that by using StreetBit, we can educate distracted pedestrians and elicit behavioral change to reduce or remove smartphone-based distractions when they enter and cross roadways. To demonstrate the feasibility of StreetBit, we conducted a field study with 385 participants. The results show that the system demonstrates adequate feasibility and behavior change in response to the StreetBit program.},

BLE beacons‐based indoor positioning systems provide an easy and energy‐efficient, low deployment cost solution for wide variety of applications including smart phones. This paper presents an in‐depth experimental study of BLE RSSI in a dense indoor environment. Due to noise, fluctuations in RSSI occur, which produces distance estimation error, which ultimately affect position estimation accuracy. The main objective of this paper is to know the variations in RSSI and develop a radio propagation model in order to minimize the distance estimation and position estimation error. Based on our real‐time experimental analysis using BLE modules, there is an average 1.32‐m position estimation error in the presence of 10‐dBm variation in RSSI. Moreover, we also observed that environmental specific radio propagation constants greatly affect distance and position estimation accuracy in BLE modules.},

However, this technology faces challenges related to Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fluctuations due to the behavior of the different advertising channels and the effect of human body shadowing among other effects. In order to mitigate these effects, the paper proposes and implements a dynamic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that uses the three different BLE advertising channels to detect human body shadowing and compensate the RSSI values accordingly. An experiment in an indoor office environment is conducted. 70% of the observations are randomly selected and used for training and the remaining 30% are used to evaluate the algorithm. The results show that the AI model can properly detect and significantly compensate RSSI values for a dynamic blockage caused by a human body. This can significantly improve the RSSI-based ranges and the corresponding positioning accuracies.},

Multi-source fusion-based localization is considered to be an effective way to provide location-based services in large-scale indoor areas. This paper presents an intelligent 3D indoor localization framework that uses the integration of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), quick response (QR) code, and micro-electro-mechanical system sensors (the 3D-WBQM framework). An enhanced inertial odometry was developed for accurate pedestrian localization and trajectory optimization in indoor spaces containing magnetic interference and external acceleration, and Wi-Fi fine time Measurement stations, BLE nodes, and QR codes were applied for landmark detection to provide an absolute reference for trajectory optimization and crowdsourced navigation database construction. In addition, the robust unscented Kalman filter (RUKF) was applied as a generic integrated model to combine the estimated location results from inertial odometry, BLE, QR, Wi-Fi FTM, and the crowdsourced Wi-Fi fingerprinting for large-scale indoor positioning. The experimental results indicated that the proposed 3D-WBQM framework was verified to realize autonomous and accurate positioning performance in large-scale indoor areas using different location sources, and meter-level positioning accuracy can be acquired in Wi-Fi FTM supported areas.},

@article{DeRaeve2022,
   abstract = {Due to the ever growing population of elderly people, there is a dramatic increase in fall accidents. Currently, multiple ideas exist to prevent the elderly from falling, by means of technology or individualised fall prevention training programs. Most of them are costly, difficult to implement or less used by the elderly, and they do not deliver the required results. Furthermore, the increasingly older population will also impact the workload of the medical and nursing personnel. Therefore, we propose a novel fall detection and warning system for nursing homes, relying on Bluetooth Low Energy wireless communication. This paper describes the hardware design of a fall-acceleration sensing wearable for the elderly. Moreover, the paper also focuses on a novel algorithm for real-time filtering of the measurement data as well as on a strategy to confirm the detected fall events, based on changes in the person's orientation. In addition, we compare the performance of the algorithm to a machine learning procedure using a convolutional neural network. Finally, the proposed filtering technique is validated via measurements and simulation. The results show that the proposed algorithm as well as the convolutional neural network both results in an excellent accuracy when validating on a common database.},

   abstract = {Injury caused by fall events is one of the greatest threats for elderly adults. This article introduces a system of fall detection including a wearable device based on Bluetooth communication, a triaxial accelerometer and a mobile phone connected to the Internet. The wearable device is used to collect the acceleration data of users, while the mobile phone receives the data and judges whether the user is fallen or not. Once the fall event is determined, the phone will send an alert message to the contacts with the fallen elderly's address. The fall detection system is reliable and efficient, as it reaches 98 percent through a great deal of testing.},

   abstract = {Falls are harmful to the elderly; therefore, fall detection technologies have been developed by many researchers to help detecting these incidents. The research presented here investigates a Bluetooth Low Energy-based local area network for fall detection. One of the major concerns is not only the detection of a fall incident but also the location where this incident occurred. This research utilizes a fall detection network with three different types of network nodes: alarm node, relay node, and center node. Alarm nodes are worn by the elderly for fall detection; relay nodes are fixed in the target area for receiving the signal from alarm nodes; and the center node is the hub of the detection network. When a fall incident occurs, the alarm node will send out alarm signals which will be passed towards the center node by the relay nodes. The center node forwards the alarm to any iMessage capable device.},
