   abstract = {In the past, the estimation of crowd density has become an important topic in the field of automatic surveillance systems. In this paper, the developed system goes one step further to estimate the number of people in crowded scenes in a complex background by using a single image. Therefore, more valuable information than crowd density can be obtained. There are two major steps in this system: recognition of the head-like contour and estimation of crowd size. First, the Haar wavelet transform (HWT) is used to extract the featured area of the head-like contour, and then the support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify these featured area as the contour of a head or not. Next, the perspective transforming technique of computer vision is used to estimate crowd size more accurately. Finally, a model world is constructed to test this proposed system and the system is also applied for real-world images.},

The objective is to integrate this system with a traffic control application such as a pedestrian control scheme at intersections. The proposed approach can also be used to detect and track humans in front of vehicles. Furthermore, the proposed schemes can be employed for the detection of several diverse traffic objects of interest (vehicles, bicycles, etc.) The system outputs the spatio-temporal coordinates of each pedestrian during the period the pedestrian is in the scene. Processing is done at three levels: raw images, blobs, and pedestrians. Blob tracking is modeled as a graph optimization problem. Pedestrians are modeled as rectangular patches with a certain dynamic behavior. Kalman filtering is used to estimate pedestrian parameters. The system was implemented on a Datacube MaxVideo 20 equipped with a Datacube Max860 and was able to achieve a peak performance of over 30 frames per second. Experimental results based on indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrated the system's robustness under many difficult situations such as partial or full occlusions of pedestrians.},

   abstract = {Microscopic pedestrian simulation models can be used to investigate pedestrian movement at the urban block and building model scale. In order to develop, calibrate and validate such microscopic models, highly accurate and detailed data on pedestrian movement and interaction behavior (e.g. collision avoidance) is required. We present a data collection approach for studying pedestrian behavior which uses the increasingly popular low-cost sensor Microsoft Kinect. The Kinect captures both standard camera data and a three-dimensional depth map. Our human detection and tracking algorithm is based on agglomerative clustering of privacy-preserving Kinect depth data captured from an elevated view - in contrast to the lateral view used for gesture recognition in Kinect gaming applications. Our approach transforms local Kinect 3D data to a common world coordinate system in order to obtain human trajectories from multiple Kinects, which allows for a scalable and flexible capturing area. At a testbed with real-world pedestrian traffic we demonstrate that our approach can provide accurate trajectories from three Kinects with a Pedestrian Detection Rate of up to 94% and a Multiple Object Tracking Precision of 4. cm. Using a comprehensive dataset of 2674 captured human trajectories we calibrate three variations of the Social Force model. Data for model calibration and validation was recorded without any script and without actors behaving according to scripted situations. Various conditions have been covered in the dataset, such as walking at different densities, walking-stopping-walking, abrupt changes of direction and random movement. The results of our model validations indicate their particular ability to reproduce the observed pedestrian behavior in microscopic simulations.},

However, automatic counting that takes place day and night is challenging due to changing lighting conditions and the complexity of scenes with many people occluding one another. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the use of a stereo thermal camera setup for pedestrian counting. We investigate the reconstruction of 3D points in a pedestrian street with two thermal cameras and propose an algorithm for pedestrian counting based on clustering and tracking of the 3D point clouds. The method is tested on two five-minute video sequences captured at a public event with a moderate density of pedestrians and heavy occlusions. The counting performance is compared to the manually annotated ground truth and shows success rates of 95.4% and 99.1% for the two sequences.},

   abstract = {The design of pedestrian-friendly infrastructures plays a crucial role in creating sustainable transportation in urban environments. Analyzing pedestrian behaviour in response to existing infrastructure is pivotal to planning, maintaining, and creating more pedestrian-friendly facilities. Many approaches have been proposed to extract such behaviour by applying deep learning models to video data. Video data, however, includes an broad spectrum of privacy-sensitive information about individuals, such as their location at a given time or who they are with. Most of the existing models use privacy-invasive methodologies to track, detect, and analyse individual or group pedestrian behaviour patterns. As a step towards privacy-preserving pedestrian analysis, this paper introduces a framework to anonymize all pedestrians before analyzing their behaviors. The proposed framework leverages recent developments in 3D wireframe reconstruction and digital in-painting to represent pedestrians with quantitative wireframes by removing their images while preserving pose, shape, and background scene context. To evaluate the proposed framework, a generic metric is introduced for each of privacy and utility. Experimental evaluation on widely-used datasets shows that the proposed framework outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art image filtering approaches by generating best privacy utility trade-off.},

   abstract = {This chapter describes the results of a series of pedestrian observation studies carried out in Norwich, Rouen and Koblenz as part of the Spatial Metro project. The goal of these studies was to observe pedestrian behaviour and to investigate pedestrian movement and experience in the city centres. The cities are engaged in improving the physical conditions and the experience of their city centres by investing in landscaping and engineering of public spaces, city beautification, wayfinding and in communication and information technology.
The Spatial Metro project brings together a transnational group of partners, enabling them to co-operate with a view to improving city centres for pedestrians. The theme of spatial metro is 'Discovering the city on Foot'. The project aims to make city visits more enjoyable for pedestrians by making them easier to navigate, easier to walk around and easier to understand and appreciate.
The project has been allocated European Regional Development Funding through the INTERREG IIIB Community Initiative. A group of ten organizations participate in Spatial Metro: The lead city of Norwich (UK) and the cities of Rouen (F), Koblenz (D), Bristol (UK), Biel/Bienne (CH), as well as academics from the University of East Anglia (UK), the Delft University of Technology (NL), the University of Koblenz (D) and the Swiss Pedestrian Association.
The main role of the chair of Urban Design was to develop instruments to evaluate visitor experience and to observe the use of public space. The purpose of the observation studies was to evaluate the use of space in relation to investments, (rather than using the outcome as a design tool to pinpoint) opportunities and threads in the city; the outcome focuses on a comparison between the actual situation and real use.
For the observation of the public space, a specific method using Global Positioning System (GPS) devices capturing the movement of pedestrians was developed and put into practice. The recording of pedestrian behaviour was accompanied by a questionnaire adding background information on the participants.
This article will focus on the differences and similarities in pedestrian behaviour in three historic cities in three countries based on quantitative and qualitative research. Do people behave different in these three historic European cities? Can we distinguish different spatial patterns based on the origin and familiarity of the visitor and the purpose and duration of the visit?
After this introduction, the set-up and implementation of the fieldwork will be explained in 'Way of Working'. Here, the methods for processing the data and the criteria employed in connection with the analysis will be clarified. Following this, the results will be described and illustrations provided for each location. The chapter concludes with a synthesis comparing the findings of the different cities.},

At large-scale events, these small but frequent uploads compete for bandwidth with the crowd's social networking activities causing transmission errors and long delays. Forwarding collected data within a peer-to-peer network allows for bundling that data and assigning the upload task to a few selected peers. On modern phones, however, peer discovery and networking is challenging due to tight restrictions of mobile operating systems. This paper shows how the announcement of internal state transitions via Bluetooth enables peers to align their operations and to accommodate for issues such as bandwidth restrictions, inexact timing, limited background activity, and idle times. Experiments on Android phones show that already for a small set of phones the proposed protocol works reliably and significantly reduces the use of the networking infrastructure. With the data delay and energy consumption in acceptable bounds, the protocol presents a viable solution for when network overload puts crowd monitoring data at risk of not being delivered in a timely manner.},

   abstract = {Indoor wireless positioning using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons have attracted considerable attention from industry and academia given the many advantages of this technology such as low power consumption, low cost, easy layout, high availability, and high precision. However, the indoor positioning accuracy always suffers from non-line of sight (NLOS) propagation, stemming from the frequently occurring instances of reflection, refraction, or scattering of BLE radio signals due to the complexity of indoor environments. This article proposes an integrity monitoring (IM) algorithm to detect and eliminate two gross errors simultaneously to solve the adverse effects caused by the NLOS. The logarithmic attenuation model based on the received signal strength indication (RSSI) of BLE realizes positioning by combining trilateration and Least Squares Based on the Taylor expansion (LSBT). Furthermore, the IM based on hypothesis testing is employed to improve the positioning quality andthe users will be alerted in time to avoid risk from positioning accuracy no longer meet user's requirement. The performance of the proposed IM algorithm has been extensively tested by conducting simulation and field experiments. The experimental results show that the IM algorithm significantly improved BLE positioning accuracy as well as the robustness of the positioning system. The 90% average error (1.9143m) in seven groups of single point experiments was reduced by 34.48% over the 90% average error (2.9143m) of the LSBT method after performing IM, and the maximum error during continuous positioning did not exceed 3m after performing IM, which were better than only using LSBT positioning.},

   abstract = {This paper addresses the efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication in a network composed of a large number of tags that transmit information to a single hub using advertisement mode. Theoretical results show that the use of advertisements enables hundreds and thousands of BLE devices to coexist in the same area and at the same time effectively transmit messages. Together with other properties (low power consumption, medium communication range, capability to detect a signal’s angle-of-arrival, etc.), this makes BLE a competing technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, as the number of communicating devices increases, the advertisement collision intensifies and the communication performance of BLE drops. This phenomena was so far analyzed theoretically, in simulations and in small-scale experiments, but large-scale experiments are not presented in the literature. This paper complements previous results and presents an experimental evaluation of a real IoT-use case, which is the deployment of over 200 tags communicating using advertisements. We evaluate the impact of the number of advertisements on the effective data reception rate and throughput. Despite the advertisement collision rate in our experiment varying between 0.22 and 0.33, we show that BLE, thanks to the multiple transmission of advertisements, can still ensure acceptable data reception rates and fulfill the requirements of a wide range of IoT applications.},

Low mobility IEEE 802.15.4 XBee S2C compliant device which is designed to collect received signal power was used and these devices were deployed at area congested with cars. The channel measurements were conducted on LOS car parking area with two scenarios; single-sided and double-sided vehicle obstruction which mimics the obstruction of metal objects. The effect of existing vehicle on the signal propagation is demonstrated based on RSSI and RMSE. The attenuation profile of vehicular obstruction on wireless signal is modeled and compared with large-scale propagation models. Results show that metal object significantly reduce transmission range and signal power. The findings may incite for future implementation of cooperative deployment program and internet of things (IoT) applications in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication.},

   abstract = {The propagation of RF signals is affected by rain and there are traditional models that allow the determination of a fade margin, to ensure operationality in periods of precipitation. Nowadays, this fact has been exploited in reverse to determine the amount of precipitation, using commercial radio links. Electromagnetic wave propagation models show that the attenuation by rain begins to have a significant impact for frequencies above 10 GHz. However, in some systems operating at 2.4 GHz there is packet loss when it is raining. So, a 2.4 GHz outdoor wireless sensor network was set up to study the influence of meteorological parameters in the received signal. Our results show a significant impact on link quality when it is raining. We also observed that temperature affects the link’s quality, exhibiting a daily cycle, improving communications when the temperature is cooler.},

   abstract = {Internet-of- Things (IoT) employs a variety of sensing technologies to monitor environment, activities, processes, and surrounding. One such sensing technology includes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) which could be used to study pedestrian traffic. This can subsequently be used to understand utilisation of spaces and to ameliorate mobility and transportation. Such studies can contribute to urban (re-)development plans to sustainably smarten the built environment, but this is only possible by having a clear understanding of the nature of BLE signal propagation and correlating its Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values to environmental topology and pedestrian movements. Additionally, in comparison to other pedestrian behaviour monitoring technologies, BLE limits pedestrians identification and hence, can be aligned to preserve their privacy. In this paper, we highlight the effect that body occlusion has on BLE RSSI values. The objective is to identify indicators in the pattern of RSSI values that identifies the way BLE devices are carried by pedestrians moving in the environment. This study will allow planners who study pedestrian traffic to form a better understanding of BLE signal propagation and signal interaction in outdoor environments. The knowledge acquired through this study will feed in to the development of an outdoor pedestrian monitoring system that is capable of identifying pedestrian behavioural patterns while preserving their privacy.},

This chapter discusses how high-level and link budget requirements can be derived and how they can be translated into low-level requirements and eventually into realizable system-design parameters. An ideal SDR offers a highly flexible and versatile platform that permits the instantiation of a variety of different waveforms with widely varying specifications. More precisely, the radio must be capable of transmitting and receiving over a wide frequency range, at various power levels and bandwidths, using different modulation and multiple access schemes. The radio must also be capable of supporting various applications ranging, for example, from simple landing aid waveforms and secure voice communication to advanced data messaging or multimedia application over ad-hoc networks. This versatility imposes on the SDR multiple sets of requirements that must be met all in one platform. This chapter later discusses high-level requirements and how they interrelate to one another and also discusses link budget analysis. Finally, the sensitivity equation that determines the required noise figure of the receiver for a given CNR is explained in detail.}

Section 8.1 presents the measurement campaigns and the related statistical analysis to obtain various channel models for wearable and implantable devices. In addition, the importance of physical human-body phantoms used for channel, Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), and Electromagnetic (EM) exposure measurements are examined. Methodologies to improve the accuracy of these phantoms for various frequency bands are also discussed. Section 8.2 outlines methodologies to improve the medium access control (MAC) and networking layers of a body area networks along with possible architectures for remote health monitoring. Several applications such as localization, activity recognition, and crowdsensing and their corresponding technical challenges are also presented in this section. Finally, Section 8.3 introduces the concept of nanocommunications which can be considered as the nano-scale limit of the IoT technology spectrum. It provides an overview of the promising mechanisms that can establish data communication at molecular levels inside the human body as well as various interfacing techniques with macro-scale devices. It also highlights the revolutionary healthcare applications that could be enabled by this technology.}
